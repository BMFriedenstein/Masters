\section{Case study: Mine B \color{blue}(Kusasalethu)}
	\subsection{Preamble}
	 This section will discuss the implementation of the simulation on a second case study. Further, the result of various simulated scenarios will be discussed. Finally validation of the the simulated scenarios using actual measurable tests will be discussed.
	\subsection{System investigation}
	The methodology was implemented on a large South African gold mine. The mine utilises five compressors supply compressed air to various surface and underground operations. An investigation was performed to gather the data and information required to build a simulation model of the network.
	\par 
	A air distribution layout was obtained, as shown in Figure \ref{fig: KUS Air layout}. The layout indicates available meters and instrumentation as well as typical airflow splits that can be used to calibrate the model. Power, pressure, flow  and guide vain control data for the compressors as well as data from flow and pressure meters along the network was gathered from the \gls{scada}.

	\end{figure}
\par 
		
	A further investigation was performed on the significant mining levels to map the locations and distribution of mining cross-section, refuge bays, leaks and other compressed air users on each level. An example of a resultant schematic from such an underground investigation is shown in Figure \ref{fig: KUS Underground level layout}

	\subsection{Model development}
			
	
	\subsubsection{Verification of baseline simulation}
	Verification of the model was done firstly by comparing the simulation outputs to actual measured values. To simplify the model, the actual measured pressure is temporarily used as set points for the compressors. This ensured that the pressure in the network is identical to that of the actual measured system as shown in Figure \ref{fig: Verification Pressure kusasalethu}.
	\par

		\caption{Verifying Pressure}
		\label{fig: Verification Pressure kusasalethu}
	\end{figure}

 	With the pressure set, the power and air flow outputs for components throughout the model were compared with their relative actual values. Figure \ref{fig: Verification Power kusasalethu} and Figure \ref{fig: Verification flow kusasalethu} shows the comparison of the total power and flow of the system. The average error for these parameters was $1.08 \%$ and $1.80 \%$ respectively. This is regarded as acceptable error margin.

	\end{figure}
	Once all the power and flow parameters were calibrated with minimal error, the compressors response to the actual pressure set-points was checked. The simulation inputs were updated with the pressure set-point profile. The compressor output pressure was then compared to the actual measured outlet, this is shown in Figure \ref{fig: Verification Pressure kusasalethu Setpoint}. The actual \gls{sp} profile is shown in green. It was noted the during peak air usage periods pressure dropped well below the desired set-point, as the compressors struggled to keep up with the air demand. This effected was reproduced in the simulation.

\section{Periodic simulation analysis}
	\subsection{Preamble}
	Updating the inputs of a simulation periodically could be used to verify simulation model accuracy. Simulation outputs remaining precise for subsequent days would indicate that the model is correctly calibrated. Additionally, periodic simulation could be used to identify significant operational changes that occur within the actual system. This would cause the simulation outputs to differ from the actual measured parameters. 
	\par 
	Periodic simulation was implemented using the process shown in Figure \ref{fig: PeriodicProcess}. Simulation input data is collected for the simulation period, this data includes only inputs that vary day to day such as schedules, ambient air conditions and  measured flows. Once the input values are collected, they are then imported into the compressed air model. The simulation performed and the output data is exported. An analysis is then performed to compare the simulated period with the actual operation of the system. This process is then repeated periodically.

		\caption{The periodic simulation process that was followed in this analysis.}
		\label{fig: PeriodicProcess}
	\end{figure}	
	     \subsection{Results}
	     Daily periodic simulation was implemented between 2016/11/01 and 2016/11/30. For each period, the simulated total flow, shaft delivery pressure and total power consumption were compared to the actual operation. The results of this analysis are shown in Figure \ref{fig: Periodic simulation}.
	     \par 
	     
	\begin{figure}[h]

		\fbox{\input{Graphs/4/Periodic1/Periodic1}}
		\caption{The flow, pressure and power error percentages for daily periodic simulations over a month.}
		\label{fig: Periodic simulation}
	\end{figure}   
The accuracy of the flow and pressure parameters of the model remained precise for the duration of the periodic simulation. However From the 2016/11/07, the accuracy of the simulated power dropped by between 10 and 15 percent. The daily average power of the system up to the point was approximately 12.5 MW, a 15\% simulation error therefore relates to 1.9 MW. This suggests a major shift in operation of the system.
\par 
A deeper analysis was to try ascertain the source of the operational change. From analysis it was noticed that the simulated power for compressor 1  no longer reflected the actual measurements. A look at the actual power measurement for compressor 1 showed a sharp decline in power starting from the 2016/11/07. At the same time the efficiency, or amount of power required per kg/s of air, of the system increased significantly from the same date. This is shown in Figure \ref{fig: MeasurementAccuracy.}. The results that there was either a major change on compressor 1 that increased the efficiency or their was a malfunction with the power meter.
