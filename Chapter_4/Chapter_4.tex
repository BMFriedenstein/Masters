\section{Introduction}
This section will validate the simulation methodology through implementation on various case studies. Mining compressed air systems were chosen for case studies based on the availability of data and the their scope for energy and operational improvement. Two different mines were selected for the studies. 
\par 
Three case studies were performed. In case study 1 and 2, improvements were simulated on mine A and mine B respectively. In Case study 3 periodic simulation analysis is implemented using the simulation developed for case study 2. From the results in the case studies, the potential benefits compressed air simulations for the South Africa mining industry is estimated.

\section{Case study 1. Simulated improvements on mine A  \tiny{\color{blue}(Beatrix 123CM)}}
\subsection{System investigation}
Mine A represents a group of three gold mining shafts and a gold processing plant in the Free state. The mine shafts and gold plant share a compressed network. Prior to this study, efforts had been made to optimise the system through \gls{dsm} energy projects. However their is potential for further optimisation. An investigation was performed to gather data and understanding of the system. At the same time, potential energy and operation improvement strategies were identified.
\par 
An air flow distribution layout was developed for the system, a simplified layout is shown in Figure \ref{fig: Beatrix Air layout}. From this along with information from the mine personal and data, an understanding of the air network's operation was obtained. 
\par

	\caption{Simplified process flow chart of the compressed air network.}

\end{figure}

The system typically uses 5 $MW$ of power,  during the drilling shift the demand increases to 6 $MW$. Figure \ref{fig: Beatrix power baseline} show the average weekday power profile between January and May 2016. Seven compresses are available in the system. Five large compressors (VK32) rated at 2.9 $MW$ each and two smaller compressors (VK10) with a power rating of 1.1 $MW$ each. No more than 4 compressors are required at any time, the other compressors are therefore on standby.

	\caption{Average power profile}
	\label{fig: Beatrix power baseline}
\end{figure}

\par
Air is supplied to the sections in three mining shafts as well as a gold processing plant on the surface. The mine normally operates the compressors with a constant pressure set-point of 500 \gls{kpa}.  The set-point is kept this high as the gold processing plant requires constant high pressure throughout the day. This makes it difficult to reduce the set-points of the compressor. It is possible to control the air supply pressure to the gold plant independently from the rest of the network. This is performed by controlling the surface valves.

\subsection{Model development}
With the data and understanding of the gathered from the investigation, a model was developed using the \gls{ptb} tool and the methodology discussed in Chapter 3. First, the simulation boundary was selected to include the measured flows to each level underground, as well as the surface processing plant. For highest accuracy, the simulation step size was set to 30 minutes to match the available data resolution.
\par
The simulation component models were developed and calibrated using the respective methods discussed in chapter 3. The following assumption were  made to simplify the model:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The effect of compressor after cooling is negligible
	\item Heat transfer over the pipe length is negligible
	\item Underground temperature and humidity remained constant for each level
	\item Surface ambient air conditions followed the average summer trend
\end{itemize} 
The model components was calibrated so that the simulated outputs matched data from the real system. The process flow diagram for the simulation is shown in Figure \ref{fig: BEET Baseline model}. The model data inputs and outputs are described in Table \ref{table: Mine A inputs/outputs}.

	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Data inputs and outputs for the Case study 1 simulation }

\end{table}

\subsubsection{Verification of model}
Verification was performed to ensure that simulated output accuracy was >95\%. Figure \ref{fig: Verification Power+flow Beatrix} (a) and (b) show the to total simulated power and flow compared to the actual actual system. The average accuracy for the system's power and total flow was 97.34\%  and  97.01\% respectively . Both these parameters were well within the target 95\% accuracy.

	\caption{The simulated flow and power compared to the actual measurement}
	\label{fig: Verification Power+flow Beatrix}
\end{figure}
The same verification was performed for the outlet pressure at the compressor. Figure \ref{fig: Verification Pressure Beatrix} compares the actual measured and simulated pressures. The accuracy of the outlet pressure was 99.1\%. This was expected simulated pressure was expected as the mine uses a constant pressure set-point for the compressors.

\end{figure}
\par
The accuracy of the model was checked in more detail to ensure that each modelled parameter matched the actual measurement with high accuracy. Table \ref{Table: A verification} shows the accuracy each measured simulation output in the model. 
\subsection{Scenario 1. Compressor set points}
The air pressure requirements underground are lower than the required pressure at the surface gold plant for most times of the day. Reducing the pressure to underground requires independently controlling the surface pressure to the gold plant. Due to the risk of loss of production, the mine would not test the scenario on the actual system. Simulation was there for required to accurately calculate and analyse the benefits of the scenario.
\par 
Using the developed simulation, the compressor Set-points were updated

\section{Case study 1: Simulated improvements on mine B \tiny{\color{blue}(Kusasalethu)}}

	\subsection{System investigation}
	Case study B is another large South African gold mine. The mine utilises five compressors supply compressed air to various surface and underground operations. An investigation was performed to gather the data and information required to build a simulation model of the network.
	\par 
	A basic air distribution layout was obtained, as shown in Figure \ref{fig: KUS Air layout}.  The figure indicates available meters and instrumentation as well as typical airflow splits to various sections and levels of the mine.
	\par

		\caption{Basic layout of the compressed air network.}
		\label{fig: KUS Air layout}
	\end{figure}
 To understand the operation of the system, schedules and set-points as well as critical limits such as minimum and maximum pressures were obtained from various personal and from the \gls{scada}. Important data parameters such as Powers, pressures, flows, etc. for the system was gathered from the \gls{scada} and other data sources. This data will be used to develop and calibrate the simulation model
\par 
		
	An in-depth investigation was performed on the significant mining levels to map the locations of mining cross-sections, refuge bays, major leaks and other compressed air consumers on each level as well as measure the usages. An example of a resultant schematic from the underground investigation is shown in Figure \ref{fig: KUS Underground level layout}

%		\caption{Underground level layout.}
%		\label{fig: KUS Underground level layout}
%	\end{figure}	
	\subsection{Model development}
	
	Using the data obtained from the investigation of the system, a  simulation model was developed in software. The modelling methodology described in Chapter 3 was then utilised to develop a model for the system. The entire model is shown in Appendix \ref{ASchematics} Figure \ref{fig: KUS Baseline model}. The model parameters were then calibrated to match the actual data from the mine.
	
	\subsubsection{Verification of baseline simulation}
	Using the verification methodology, the simulation model was performed by comparing the simulation outputs to actual measured values. To simplify the model, the actual measured pressure is temporarily used as set points for the compressors. This ensured that the pressure in the network is identical to that of the actual measured system as shown in Figure \ref{fig: Verification Pressure kusasalethu}.
	
	\par 
	
	\begin{figure}[h]
		\centering
		\input{Graphs/4/KusVerify/Pressure/Pressure}
		\caption{Comparing the pressure response of simulation to the actual measured pressure}
		\label{fig: Verification Pressure kusasalethu}
	\end{figure}

 	With the pressure set, the power and air flow outputs for components throughout the model were compared with their relative actual values. Figure \ref{fig: Verification Power kusasalethu} shows the comparison of the total power and flow of the system with the actual measure values for that same period. The accuracy for these parameters compared to the real system was $98.7 \%$ and $99.0 \%$ respectively. This was regarded as acceptable accuracy.

		(b)\\
		\caption{Verification of the total (a) flow and (b) power of the system using the actual pressure profile.}
		\label{fig: Verification Power kusasalethu}
	\end{figure}

	Once all the power and flow parameters were checked calibrated with minimal error, the system's response to the pressure set-points was checked. The compressor models were replaced with the pressure set-point profile instead of the measured outlet pressure profile. The simulated outlet pressure was then compared to the actual measured outlet, this is shown in Figure \ref{fig: Verification Pressure kusasalethu Setpoint}.

	\end{figure}
	\subsection{Scenario 1. Refuge bay optimisation}
	From investigations that were conducted on the mines compressed system, unnecessary refuge bay leaks were identified as a significant inefficiency that can be reduced. A test on a single mining level was performed to  measure the potential flow saving of reducing refuge bay leaks. The test showed that a reduction refuge bay leaks, by closing the valves would lead to a air saving of $0.05$ $kg/s$ per refuge bay at typical operational pressures. This measurement was conservative as not all the refuge bays on the level could be closed for the test. 
	\par 
	Extending these tests to include the rest of the mining sections was not practical due to the size of the mine and high resourse requirement . Therefore, the benefits bay could not accurately be determined from practical tests. Using simulation the typical operation with can be accurately compare with the intervention scenario to quantify the potential financial and operational benefits throughout a given period.
	\par
	The simulation model detail was selected to recreate the scenario within 2\% error. To model auto-compression, the depth of each compressed air component was included into the simulation. Using the per-level layouts obtained from the investigation the location of refuge bay components were identified. Refuge bay leak components were then added to the simulation to replicate the measured leak from each refuge bay. These leaks were modelled as flow demands using the data from the initial refuge bay tests. The overall mass flow of the system was maintained to keap the model accurate. The simulation was verified with an accuracy of 98\% using actual data from the mine. The full simulation process flow diagram is shown in Figure \ref{fig: Refuge bay layout} in Appendix \ref{Schematics}.

	\subsection{Scenario 2. Closing off levels and inactive work areas}
	Due to the high prevalence of compressed air misuse, leaks and open valves, significant amounts of air is still used during periods where it is not required. Reducing pressure to areas during the times may lead to a major power and cost saving. Using simulation, tests can be done to identify the benefits of reducing pressure to inactive mining sections.

	The effect of in-stope control during peak times was simulated for level 105L. The level was modelled to include all major leaks, refuge bays and drilling sections that were manually identified from the level investigations. This is shown in the simulation diagram shown in Figure For comparison, station isolation and the combination of in-stope control and station isolation were simulated.

\section{Case study C: Periodic simulation analysis}
	\subsection{Preamble}
	Updating the inputs of a simulation periodically could be used to verify simulation model accuracy. If the precision of simulation outputs remains for subsequent days, this would indicate that the model is correctly calibrated. Additionally, this process could be used to identify significant operational changes that occur within the system. This would cause the simulation outputs to differ from the actual measured parameters. 
	\par 
	A daily periodic simulation  analysis was implemented between 2016/11/01 and 2016/11/30 using the periodic simulation methodology discussed in Chapter 3. The simulation model developed for case study A was used for the analysis. The simulation receives the data inputs shown in table \ref{table: Periodic inputs/outputs}.
	\begin{table}[h]
		\centering
		\begin{tabular}{ll}
			\hline
			Inputs \hspace*{4cm}    &Outputs \hspace*{4cm}    \\  \hline
			Ambient air conditions&Compressor power \\
			Measured flows& Flows \\
			Compressor schedules& Pressures \\
			\hline
		\end{tabular}
		\caption{Data inputs and outputs for the simulation}
		\label{table: Periodic inputs/outputs}
	\end{table}

\subsection{Results}

 The process was triggered daily. For each period, data inputs shown in table \ref{table: Periodic inputs/outputs} were imported into the model, the simulation was then processed and the outputs are compared with the real system parameters. Figure \ref{fig: Periodic simulation} shows the average daily accuracy of the simulated total system power, flow and the shaft pressure per period.
	     \par 
     
	\begin{figure}[h]
		\centering
		\input{Graphs/4/Periodic1/Periodic1}
		\caption{The flow, pressure and power error percentages for daily periodic simulations over a month.}
		\label{fig: Periodic simulation}
	\end{figure}   
The accuracy of the process parameters of the simulation was within 5\% for the duration of the periodic simulation. However, From the 2016/11/07, the accuracy of the simulated power dropped by between 10 and 15 percent. The daily average power of the system up to the point was approximately 12.5 MW, a 15\% simulation error therefore relates to 1.9 MW difference between simulated and actual parameters. This suggests a major shift in operation of the system.
\par 
An analysis was done to try determine the source of the discrepancy. From the data it was identified that the simulated power for compressor 1 was the source of the different A look at the actual power measurement for compressor 1 show drop compared to normal operation by almost 2 MW. At the same time the power used per kg/s of air seemed to have dropped. Figure \ref{fig: MeasurementAccuracy.} shows the average daily power for compressor 1 (blue), compared to the air mass flow per Watt(yellow). 
	\begin{figure}[h]
		\centering
		\input{Graphs/4/PeriodicRange/PeriodicRange}
		\caption{Supply efficiency and Compressor 1's average power output over the time of the periodic analysis.}
		\label{fig: MeasurementAccuracy.}
	\end{figure} 
As a 2 MW shift in power is not likely from, the results seem to show that there was a fault in the power metering starting from 2016/11/07. This explains the perceived increase in efficiency over the same period as a less power is measure then is actually being provided. In this situation the simulated power measurement is actually a more accurate metric for compressor 1's power over this period.  
   \subsection{Validation}
To validate that the change identified using periodic simulation was caused by the power meter, data from the substation was compared to the combined individual compressors meters. This comparison is shown in Figure \ref{fig: Corrected Periodic simulation}. The comparison shows that the substation power measurement strays from the compressors at the same time that compressor 1 average daily power drops.
