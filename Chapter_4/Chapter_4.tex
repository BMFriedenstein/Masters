\section{Introduction}
This section will validate the simulation methodology through case studies. Mining compressed air systems were chosen as case studies based on the availability of data and the scope for energy and operational improvement. Two different mines were selected for the studies. 
\par 
Three case studies were performed. In case study 1 and 2, improvements were simulated on mine A and mine B respectively. In Case study 3 periodic simulation analysis is implemented using the simulation developed for case study 2. From the results in the case studies, the potential benefits compressed air simulations for the South Africa mining industry is estimated and discussed.

\section{Case study 1. Simulated improvements on mine A}
\subsection{System investigation}
Mine A represents a group of three gold mining shafts and a gold processing plant in the Free state province. The mine shafts and gold plant share a compressed network. Prior to this study, efforts had been made to optimise the system through \gls{dsm} energy projects. However, there may still be potential for further optimisation. An investigation was performed to gather data and understanding of the system and to identify potential energy and operation improvement strategies.
\par 
An air flow distribution layout was developed for the system, a simplified layout is shown in \cref{fig: Beatrix Air layout}. From this along with information from the mine personal and data, an understanding of the air network's operation was obtained. The system typically utilises 5 $MW$ of power. During the drilling shift the demand increases to 6 $MW$. \cref{fig: Beatrix power baseline} show the average weekday power profile between January and May 2016.

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\input{Graphs/4/BeetBaseline/Power/Power}
	\caption{Average power profile}
	\label{fig: Beatrix power baseline}
\end{figure}

\par 
 Seven compresses are available in the system. Five large compressors (VK32) rated at 2.9 $MW$ each and two smaller compressors (VK10) with a power rating of 1.1 $MW$ each. No more than 4 compressors are required at any time, the other compressors are therefore on standby. Air is supplied to the sections in three mining shafts as well as a gold processing plant on the surface. 
 \par 
 The mine normally operates the compressors with a constant pressure set-point of 500 \glssymbol{kpa}. The set-point is kept this high as the gold processing plant requires constant high pressure throughout the day. This makes it difficult to reduce the set-points of the compressor. It is possible to control the air supply pressure to the gold plant independently from the rest of the network. This is performed by controlling the surface valves.
 \par 
  The evening Eskom energy peak time was identified as a period where savings could be obtained. During this time, air is not required underground as blasting is scheduled. Due to the energy tariff structure, interventions during the energy peak also maximises the financial benefit for the mine. Compressor set- point control and underground valve control were identified as strategies to achieve these savings. Due to the risk of loss of production, the mine would not allow practically testing the scenario on the actual system. Simulation was therefore required to accurately calculate and analyse the benefits of the of compressor set points. A model was developed to test these scenarios.

\subsection{Model development}
With the data and understanding of the gathered from the investigation, a model was developed using the \gls{ptb} tool and the methodology discussed in Chapter 3. First, the simulation boundary was selected to include the measured flows to each level underground, as well as the surface processing plant. For highest accuracy, the simulation step size was set to 30 minutes to match the available data resolution.
\par
The simulation component models were developed and calibrated using the respective methods discussed in chapter 3. The following assumptions were made to simplify the model development:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The effect of compressed air after-cooling is negligible
	\item Heat transfer over the pipe length is negligible
	\item Underground temperature and humidity remained constant for each level
	\item Surface ambient air conditions followed normal summer trend
\end{itemize} 
The model components was calibrated so that the simulated outputs matched data from the real system. The process flow diagram for the simulation is shown in \cref{fig: BEET Baseline model}. The model data inputs and outputs are described in \cref{table: Mine A inputs/outputs}.

\end{table}


\subsection{Verification of model}
Verification was performed to ensure that simulated output accuracy was $>95$\%. \cref{fig: Verification power Beatrix}, \cref{fig: Verification power Beatrix} and \cref{fig: Verification Pressure Beatrix} show the to total simulated power ,flow and outlet pressure of the compressors compared to the system. The average accuracy for the power and total flow was 97.34\%  and  97.01\% Respectively . Both these parameters were well within the target relative error of 5\% accuracy. The accuracy of the outlet pressure was 99.1\%. This was expected simulated pressure was expected as the mine uses a constant pressure set-point for the compressors.

Accuracy of the model was checked in more detail to ensure that each modelled parameter matched the actual measurement with high accuracy. \cref{Table: A verification} shows the accuracy each measured simulation output in the model.
\subsection{Scenario 1. Compressor set points}
The Eskom evening peak tariff time occurs during the blasting shift. During this shift, the pressure requirements underground are lower than the rest of the day. Reducing pressure in the network reduces power as less work is required from the compressors. Additionally, losses caused leaks, open valves, etc. are reduced. However, lowering the pressure set-point of the compressors requires independently controlling the air to the gold plant. 
\par 
Using the verified simulation model, the compressor set-points were reduced to 420  \glssymbol{kpa}, the minimum allowed compressor set-point during the drilling shift. The compressor schedule was changed to allow independent control of the gold plant pressure. Gold plant pressure was maintained at 490 \glssymbol{kpa}. 
\par 
The results of the simulation, shown, in \cref{fig: CompSetpoints Results Beatrix}, indicated an average power reduction of 0.46 MW \gls{pc}. This energy optimisation relates to a R0.37 M \gls{pa} energy cost saving to the mine.

	\caption{Energy savings by reducing compressor set-points}
	\label{fig: CompSetpoints Results Beatrix}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Scenario 2. Control valves set points}
An alternative scenario is to reduce the pressure at the control valves at each level. By reducing pressure at the control, set-points can be lowered to the minimum requirement per level. This can lead to higher savings than could be achieved through compressor set-points. This scenario would be relatively easy to implement as it does not require any changes to the compressor control schedule.
\par 
Air pressure set-points were reduced to 300 kPa at  the underground control valves during the evening peak period. Analysis of the simulation results showed a  1MW average \gls{pc} saving. The intervention would lead to an annual cost saving of R0.91M.

\subsection{Comparison of scenario results}
Comparing the scenarios in \cref{Table: A Comparison} showed that Scenario 2 had a larger peak energy impact then scenario 1. Further savings could be achieved through a combination of the two scenarios as well as investigating set-point reductions during other periods of the day.

\subsection{Validation of results}
Scenario 2 was implemented on the actual compressed air system. An energy saving of just under 1 MW \gls{pc} was recorded when compared with the 2016 power baseline profile. These results matched the simulated scenario closely. \cref{fig: Actual permormance beet} shows the practical result compared with the simulated and baseline power profiles.

\subsection{Summary}
A case study was implemented mine compressed air network in the Freestate. Following the simulation methodology, An investigation was performed to gather data and identify potential interventions. A simulation model was developed to test scenarios. The tested interventions showed a \gls{pc} saving of 1 MW which would result in a cost saving of R0.9M. The simulated was validated by implementation on the actual system leading to similar results.
\section{Case study 2: Simulated improvements on mine B}
	\subsection{System investigation}
	Case study B is large South African gold mine. The mine utilises five compressors supply compressed air to various surface and underground operations. An investigation was performed to gather the data and information required to build a simulation model of the network. As well as to identify potential simulation scenarios.

	\end{figure}
\clearpage
A basic air distribution layout was developed for the system.  Figure  II.?? Illustrates the system process in detail, indicating instrumentation, meters as well as normal airflow splits to various sections and levels of the mine.
\par 
 Data related to the mines scheduling as well as critical limits and set-points of the compressed air system was obtained from various mine personnel.  From this a general understanding of the operation was obtained. Important data parameters such as Power, pressures and flows of the system were gathered from the \gls{scada} as well other data measurement sources. This data will be used to develop and calibrate the simulation model
\par 
		
Per-level investigations were performed on the significant mining levels to map and measure the locations and air usage for the cross-sections, refuge bays, major leaks and other compressed air consumers on each level. An example of a resultant schematic from the underground investigation is shown in \cref{fig: KUS Underground level layout}.  The information gathered from the system investigations was then utilised to develop and calibrate a simulation model.
	
\subsection{Model development}
	
Using the data obtained from the investigations on the network, a simulation model was developed in \gls{ptb}. The methodology described in Chapter 3 was utilised in this process. The following assumptions made to simplify the model development:
\begin{itemize}
	\item After cooling reduced compressed air temperature from $ 60 ^o $ \gls{c} to $ 40 ^o $ \gls{c}
	\item Underground temperature and humidity remained constant for each level
\end{itemize}
 The boundaries of the baseline simulation were selected based on the available data for the network. The developed simulation model is shown in \cref{fig: KUS Baseline model}. For maximum accuracy, the simulation step size was set to the two minutes to match the resolution available from the data source.
The model components was calibrated so that the simulated outputs matched data from the real system. The process flow diagram for the simulation is shown in \cref{fig: KUS Baseline model}. The model data inputs and outputs are described in \cref{table: Mine A inputs/outputs}.

\end{table}
	
	\subsubsection{Verification of baseline simulation}
	Using the verification methodology, the simulation model verified by comparing the simulation outputs to actual measured values. The compressors outlet pressure often does not match the set-point. To simplify the verification, the measured outlet pressure is temporarily used as set points for the compressors. This ensured that the pressure in the network is identical to that of the actual system as shown in \cref{fig: Verification Pressure kusasalethu}.
	\par 
	\begin{figure}[h]

		\input{Graphs/4/KusVerify/Pressure/Pressure}
		\caption{Comparing the pressure response of simulation to the actual measured pressure}
		\label{fig: Verification Pressure kusasalethu}
	\end{figure}

 	With the simulated pressure identical to the actual, the power and air flow outputs were compared with their relative actual values. \cref{fig: Verification Power kusasalethu} shows the comparison of the total power and flow of the system with the actual measure values for that same period. The accuracy for these parameters compared to the real system was $98.7 \%$ and $99.0 \%$ respectively. This was within the acceptable error.

	Once the power and flow parameters were verified with acceptable error, the actual pressure set-point profile was imported to the compressor controllers. The simulated outlet pressure was then compared to the actual measured pressure and set-point, this is shown in \cref{fig: Verification Pressure kusasalethu Setpoint}. The accuracy of the compressor outlet pressure was acceptable at 99.02 \%. To ensure the model accuracy, all measured flows and pressures were compared to the simulated outputs. This comparison is shown in \cref{Table: B verification}.

	\end{figure}

	\subsection{Scenario 1. Refuge bay optimisation}
	From investigation, unnecessary refuge bay leaks were identified as a significant inefficiency that can be reduced. A test on a single mining level was performed to  measure the potential flow saving of reducing refuge bay leaks. The test showed that by reducing refuge bay leaks, by closing the valves, would lead to an average air saving of $0.05$ $kg/s$ per refuge bay at typical operational pressures. This measurement was conservative as it was not possible to close all the refuge bays on the level for the test. 
	\par 
	Due to the size of the mine, extending these tests to include the rest of the mining sections was not practical. Therefore, the benefits of an intervention on the entire mine could not accurately be determined from practical tests. Using simulation the typical operation with can be accurately compare with the intervention scenario to quantify the potential financial and operational benefits throughout a given period.
	\par
	The simulation model boundaries was updated to include refuge bay leaks on each level. For each refuge chamber, a air leak was added to the model by utilising per level layouts indicating locations of refuge bays. These leaks were modelled as flow demands using the data from the initial refuge bay tests. The overall mass flow of the system was maintained to ensure model accuracy. T  By adding the flow component in the actual location in the process, the pressure to each chamber is correctly modelled. The full simulation model is shown in \cref{fig: Refuge bay layout}. The updated simulation model was re-checked to ensure accuracy. This model was used as a baseline to quantify saving for the scenario.
	\par 
	To create the optimised scenario, the refuge bay flow components were set to 0 $kg/s$. The simulation was performed and the output data compared ot the baseline. \cref{fig: RefugeBay Power.} shows the baseline power compared to the optimised scenario. The comparison showed a potential 0.92 MW  improvement in \gls{ee} through optimisation of refuge bay leaks. The optimised scenario would lead to a R5.13M energy cost saving for the mine.

		\caption{The Baseline system power compared to the system power when refuge bay leaks are reduced.}
		\label{fig: RefugeBay Power.}
	\end{figure}   
	An additional pressure benefit was identified during the drilling shift, shown in  \cref{fig: RefugeBay Pressures.}. The reduced flow lead to a pressure increase of about 15 \glssymbol{kpa}. The pressure increase could lead to an increase in drilling efficiency.

		\caption{The Baseline system pressure compared to the system pressure when refuge bay leaks are reduce.}
		\label{fig: RefugeBay Pressures.}
	\end{figure}  
	\subsection{Scenario 2. Closing off levels and inactive work areas}
	Due to the high prevalence of compressed air misuse, leaks and open valves, significant amounts of air is still used during periods where it is not required. Reducing pressure to areas during these times may lead to a major power and cost saving. Using simulation, tests can be done to identify the benefits of reducing pressure to inactive mining sections.
	\par 
	Strategies to reduce airflow during peak times was simulated for level 105L. The level was modelled to include all major leaks, refuge bays and drilling sections that were manually identified from the level investigation. This is shown in the simulation diagram shown in \cref{fig: KUS Simulation level layout}. 
	\begin{figure}[h!]

		\fbox{\includegraphics[angle=90,trim = 0 20cm 0 80cm, clip,height=0.95\textheight]{Images/A/StopeSim}}

		\label{fig: KUS Simulation level layout}
	\end{figure}	
	\clearpage
	Station control, in-stope control and a combination were simulated were all simulated for 105L. Station control means control of the pressure of at the station of the level. In-stope control is control of the is cut the airflow to the mining section during certain periods. \cref{fig: 105 Flow savings} shows the effect the various interventions have on  the flow for 105L compared to the baseline.

	\end{figure}
Station control had the largest impact on the flow usage for the level. This reflects with the power reduction achieved for each intervention shown in \cref{fig: Station vs stope}. The impact was 0.4 and 0.7 MW for the stope and station intervention respectively.

A simulation was done to estimate the potential savings of extending the evening station control to other levels. This was performed by updating the flow demands for levels 95- 115 to match the flow saving achieved in the 105L simulation. The savings achieved for the general station control were 2.0 MW \gls{pc}, shown in \cref{fig: General station optimise}. It was calculated that this would lead to a annual energy cost saving of R2.5M.

\section{Case study 3: Periodic simulation analysis}
	\subsection{Preamble}
	Updating the inputs of a simulation periodically could be used to verify simulation model accuracy. If the precision of simulation outputs remains for subsequent days, this would indicate that the model is correctly calibrated. Additionally, this process could be used to identify significant operational changes that occur within the system. This would cause the simulation outputs to differ from the actual measured parameters. 
	\par 
	A daily periodic simulation  analysis was implemented between 2016/11/01 and 2016/11/30 using the periodic simulation methodology discussed in Chapter 3. The simulation model developed for case study A was used for the analysis. The simulation receives the data inputs shown in \cref{table: Periodic inputs/outputs}.
	\begin{table}[h]
		\centering
		\begin{tabular}{ll}
			\hline
			Inputs \hspace*{4cm}    &Outputs \hspace*{4cm}    \\  \hhline{==}

			\hline
		\end{tabular}
		\caption{Data inputs and outputs for the simulation}

	\end{table}

\subsection{Results}

 The process was triggered daily. For each period, data inputs shown in \cref{table: Periodic inputs/outputs} were imported into the model, the simulation was then processed and the outputs are compared with the real system parameters. \cref{fig: Periodic simulation} shows the average daily accuracy of the simulated total system power, flow and the shaft pressure per period.
	     \par 
     
	\begin{figure}[h]
		\centering
		\input{Graphs/4/Periodic1/Periodic1}
		\caption{The flow, pressure and power error percentages for daily periodic simulations over a month.}
		\label{fig: Periodic simulation}
	\end{figure}   
The accuracy of the process parameters of the simulation was within 5\% for the duration of the periodic simulation. However, From the 2016/11/07, the accuracy of the simulated power dropped by between 10 and 15 percent. The daily average power of the system up to the point was approximately 12.5 MW, a 15\% simulation error therefore relates to 1.9 MW difference between simulated and actual parameters. This suggests a major shift in operation of the system.
\par 
An analysis was done to try determine the source of the discrepancy. From the data it was identified that the simulated power for compressor 1 was the source of the different A look at the actual power measurement for compressor 1 show drop compared to normal operation by almost 2 MW. At the same time the power used per kg/s of air seemed to have dropped. \cref{fig: MeasurementAccuracy.} shows the average daily power for compressor 1 (blue), compared to the air mass flow per Watt(yellow). 
	\begin{figure}[h]
		\centering
		\input{Graphs/4/PeriodicRange/PeriodicRange}
		\caption{Supply efficiency and Compressor 1's average power output over the time of the periodic analysis.}
		\label{fig: MeasurementAccuracy.}
	\end{figure} 
As a 2 MW shift in power is not likely from, the results seem to show that there was a fault in the power metering starting from 2016/11/07. This explains the perceived increase in efficiency over the same period as a less power is measure then is actually being provided. In this situation the simulated power measurement is actually a more accurate metric for compressor 1's power over this period.  
   \subsection{Validation}
To validation of misreadings from the power meter from comparing independent power data for the substation to the combined individual compressors meters.\cref{fig: Corrected Periodic simulation} shows the measured power from the two sources. By comparing the compressor power to the independent data, it is clear that there is an error in measurement as hypothesised.

	\subsection{Summary}
\section{Potential benefit for SA mines}
There are proximately 75 operational gold and \gls{pgm} mines in South Africa, as illustrated in \cref{fig: Mine map} \footnote{ Chamber of Mines, [Online] \url{http://www.chamberofmines.org.za/sa-mining/gold}, [Accessed 16-06-2017]}$^,$\footnote{ Chamber of Mines, [Online] \url{http://www.chamberofmines.org.za/sa-mining/platinum}, [Accessed 16-06-2017]}. Each mine utilises compressed air for underground processes. By utilising the compressed air simulation methodology in this study, the mines could collectively achieve significant energy and cost savings for the industry.

In this study, the simulated interventions resulted in savings of (on average) 0.69 MW \gls{ee} or 1.025 $ MW $ \gls{pc}. Assuming similar intervention were identified, through simulation for all gold and platinum mines. A potential energy saving of approximately 50 MW \gls{ee} or  75 $ MW $ \gls{pc} could be achieved. The combined cost saving for these interventions would amount to up to R400M \gls{pa}.
