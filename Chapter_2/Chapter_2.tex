\section{Introduction}
 This chapter commences in Section 2.2 by providing relevant background on the operation and subcomponents of compressed air networks. A review follows in Section 3.2 of the literature regarding compressed air energy interventions and it summarises previous work to improve the supply and demand efficiency of mining compressed air networks.
\par
The use of simulation in mining systems is reviewed next. Section 2.4 summarises the usage of mathematical estimation and simulations tools in the mining industry and discusses the simulation tools, as well as simulation and verification procedures that were available in the literature.
\par
Finally, simulation usage in compressed air systems is discussed. Section 2.5 summarises the successes and shortfalls in previous compressed air simulation studies.
\section{Background on mining compressed air networks}
\subsection{Preamble}
Compressed air is used extensively in a mine in both surface and underground operations. This section provides background regarding the compressed air networks used in mines. It firstly discusses the components that make up a mining compressed air system, then examines the typical functioning of the system and finally discusses the instrumentation that is typically installed in compressed air networks.
\subsection{Compressor air network components}
\subsubsection{Compressors}
Compressed air in mining is most commonly supplied by a centrifugal-type dynamic compressor \cite{Fouche2016Masters}, \cite{Booysen2012Masters}. These machines achieve compression as a result of the centrifugal force from the high-speed rotation of impellers in the air. An electric motor drives the rotating impeller.
\par 
 Multi-stage impeller compressor designs, as shown in \Cref{fig: Compressor diagram}, are used to obtain higher  pressure ratios \cite{Fouche2016Masters}. The compression process is inefficient. Only about 5 to 10\% of the input energy of the process is converted into energy that is used \cite{yang2009air}.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Pneumatic rock drills}
Drilling is performed mainly in the production areas or stopes of a mine. Drill machines are used to drill holes into the rock face, and once the holes have been drilled, explosives are installed to break up the rock \cite{van2008development}.
\par
Compressed air is used to power pneumatic rock drills inside a mine. These drills convert energy at an efficiency of 2\%, which is quite low when compared to alternative rock drills such as electric, oil electro-hydraulic and hydro-powered drills that convert energy at an efficiency of between 20-31\% \cite{fraser2008saving}, \cite{vanTonder2010Masters}. 
\subsubsection{Refuge bays}
Refuge bays are installed underground in deep-level mines to provide safety to miners in the event of an emergency. Due to safety regulations, most mines will utilise compressed air to deliver fresh air to the chamber \cite{brake1999criteria}. \Cref{fig: Refuge Bay} shows an example of a compressed air inlet at an underground refuge bay. A muffler is installed at the end of the inlet air pipe to reduce noise.
\par 
Altogether 1.42 $l/s$ of air per person at a pressure of between 200 and 300 \gls{kpa} is required to provide oxygen and prevent any poisonous gas entering the refuge \cite{brake1999criteria}. Airflow in the refuge bays is controlled by a manual valve inside the room. The manual valves are often misused by mine workers to cool the bay through decompression of the air. %[CitationNeeded]

	\caption{Example of a compressed air inlet in an underground refuge bay chamber of a mine}
	\label{fig: Refuge Bay}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Processing plants}
Processing plants are constructed near mines. They are used when extracting metal from the ore that is obtained from the mining operation.  These plants use compressed air for various systems, processes and equipment. 
\par 
Processing plants often share a compressed air networks with mine to save costs \cite{Marais2012PhD}. The plants use relatively small amounts of air compared to mines. However, plant processes have pressure requirements that differ from the rest of the air network. If the plant air supply is not isolated from the shaft's air system, energy optimisation can be complicated \cite{Kriel2014Masters}. 
\subsubsection{Other compressed air users}
Due to its availability underground, compressed air is used for several other applications. These usages include pneumatic loaders or rock shovels, pneumatic cylinders, dam sediment agitation, cooling and ventilation and many other applications. Unfortunately, this vast variety of applications also leads to the misuse of compressed air, which in turn leads to inefficient operation \cite{Marais2012PhD}.
\subsection{Operational schedule}
On a typical mine, various operations are scheduled for different times of the day. Depending on the activity taking place, many mines will control the pressure to meet the requirements of the tasks \cite{Marais2012PhD}, \cite{Kriel2014Masters}. \Cref{fig: Mining schedule} shows the schedule and pressure requirement on a typical deep-level mine.
\par 
As shown in \Cref{fig: Mining schedule}, the pressure requirement changes, depending on the activity that is taking place. The drilling shift typically has the highest pressure requirement, whereas the blasting shift requires the lowest. This fluctuating pressure requirement shows scope for optimisation. However, it has been observed that many mines do not optimise their compressed air supply efficiently \cite{padachi2009energy}.
Since the schedules and operation philosophies differ between mines, different operational schedules require alternative pressure requirement profiles.

	\label{fig: Mining schedule}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Instrumentation}
For large industrial systems, instrumentation is necessary to monitor performance and equipment conditions throughout the system. In a mining compressed air network, instrumentation is installed to monitor flows, pressures, temperatures and other process parameters. Electrical instrumentation is also installed for sensing currents, power factors, voltages and power. Parameters that are often measured include valves input/output pressures and flows, valve and guide vane positions and air condition metrics, which are usually measured with instrumentation.	
\par
\Gls{scada} systems are used to monitor and control processes throughout the mine. The instrumentation and \gls{scada} systems are connected on a communication network.
This communication between the underground \glspl{plc} and surface \gls{scada} is achieved by using a significant fibre optic network \cite{schroeder2009energy}. The \gls{scada} system centralises instrumentation data from \glspl{plc} and instrumentation in the mine. It is also used to control machines and control instrumentation by transmitting signals over the network. 
\subsection{Summary}
This section was devoted to a discussion of various subcomponents of compressed air networks, such as compressors, processing plants as well as underground air users. The daily process scheduling and the effect on compressed air requirements were also reviewed. Finally, the typical instrumentation found in a mining compressed air system was summarised.
\section{Review of compressed air energy interventions in industry}
	\subsection{Preamble}
		Compressed air improvement can be achieved through intervention in either the supply or demand processes of a compressed air system \cite{Kriel2014Masters}. The supply processes are improved by increasing the efficiency of the compressed air supply. Examples of air supply optimisation measures include \gls{dcs}, compressor relocation, repairs and maintenance \cite{Snyman2011Masters}.
		\par
		Due to the size of mining compressed air networks, there is often a larger scope for improvement in air demand. Air usage is improved by optimising consumer usage patterns, reducing leaks and performing other interventions. Air demand optimisations include reducing unnecessary air use, optimising control and reducing system pressures \cite{kleingeld2010high}.
		\par
	 	 This section will review compressed air supply and demand interventions that have improved energy or operational efficiency in the mining industry. Based on the literature, successes and shortcomings in previous studies will be discussed and analysed.
	 	
	\subsection{Strategies to improve compressed air supply}

		\subsubsection{Optimising compressor control}
		The number of available compressors, as well as the compressor power ratings differ between compressed air systems. Compressor selection is crucial to ensure that the correct compressors are matched with the requirements of the system \cite{marais2010expert}.
		\par 
		Booysen \cite{Booysen2012Masters} found that many mines control compressors by using fixed pressure points that are much higher than required. In one system, compressor controllers were set to target 650 \glssymbol{kpa} to ensure that pressure underground did not fall below 500 \glssymbol{kpa}. Use of high  set-points can lead to excessive, wasteful blow-off in a deep-level when the pressure exceeds maximum operating points.
		\par
		 Booysen \cite{booysen2009optimising} furthermore showed that energy savings can be achieved through dynamic pressure  set-point control\footnote{Matching the supplied pressure with the specifically required air demand} and optimal compressor selection. In a case study, an average power demand reduction of 1.07 MW was achieved which lead to an energy improvement and an estimated cost saving of R3m.
		\par 
	 	Optimising control of compressors to match the demand of the system can be complicated. \glspl{vsd} and guide-vanes are used to control the capacity of the network. More effective power reductions can be achieved through the use of \gls{vsd} control \cite{Bredenkamp2013Masters}. However, installing such  controllers can be very costly.
	 	\par 
	 	 Running compressors at part load will reduce the efficiency. Research has shown that electric motors will typically use 60-80\% of their rated power when operating at less than 50\% load \cite{Saidur2010}.

		\subsubsection{Reconfiguring compressed air networks}
			Some old mining compressed air systems have not been adequately maintained and improved. Often they cannot sufficiently supply air to meet the demand or air is provided from non-optimal sources. In a study by Bredenkamp \cite{Bredenkamp2013Masters}, reconfiguring of the air network was investigated to improve these systems.
			\par 
			In this study, Bredenkamp investigated the interconnection of compressed air systems of two mining shafts and relocation of a compressor. This strategy led to an average power reduction of 1.7 MW and an estimated annual energy cost saving of R8.9m at the time.

	\subsection{Strategies to reduce compressed air demand}
	Decreasing the airflow demand is achieved by reducing additional airflow such as leaks, optimising the operating pressure to match the demand\footnotemark[2], and improving the efficiency of air usage or replacing equipment with non-pneumatic alternatives \cite{Snyman2011Masters}.
		 \footnotetext[2]{Matching the supplied pressure with the required air demand. Optimising the supply is achieved by identifying the minimum required operating pressure for all times of the day as illustrated in \Cref{fig: Mining schedule}}
		 \subsubsection{Leakage detection}	 
		 Air leaks are a major inefficiency in compressed air systems. Fixing leaks is an effective measure to reduce air demand and improve the efficiency of the system \cite{van2011sustaining}. However, identifying leaks is difficult and time-consuming.
		 \par 
		  Air leaks occur as a result of open pipes, fissures and breaks. Losses depend on the size of the leak and pressure in the network. \Cref{fig: Leak losses} shows the theoretical airflow through a pipe orifice as a function of leakage area and pressure\footnotemark[1]. According to van Tonder \cite{van2011sustaining} the system power consumption linearly increases with the amount of air leakage. Therefore, energy savings can be achieved through either reducing pressure or detecting and fixing leaks.

	 \footnotetext[2]{Leakage detection by using strategically placed measurement equipment and smart computer systems}
	 \footnotetext[3]{The use of a device, \enquote{pig}, within the pipe to perform inspections}
	 \par 
		 Although leaks are often difficult to detect through visual methods, many techniques can be employed in industry to detect air leaks. Pascoe \cite{Pascoe2016Masters} and van Tonder \cite{vanTonder2010Masters} summarise these techniques as follows:
		 \begin{itemize}
		 	\item Audible detection (Walk and report)
		 	\item Ultrasonic detection
		 	\item Intelligent systems\footnotemark[2]
		 	\item \enquote{Pigging}\footnotemark[3]
		 	\item Soap water/visible dyes 
		 \end{itemize}
	 	 These methods are time and resource intensive, and many mines do not actively employ dedicated leakage detection and repair teams. Marais \textit{et al.} \cite{marais2009increased} investigated how to streamline the leakage detection and repair process to increase energy savings by using a \gls{calds}. The system was developed to allow centralised mobile leakage reporting. Usage of \gls{calds} in mines resulted in an increased leak detection rate. For instance, one mine reported 24 leaks in a single month. It was noted in the study by Marais that there was difficulty quantifying the actual energy savings of the leakage repairs, due to the co-occurrence of other interventions.	
		 
		 \subsubsection{Underground control valves optimisation}
		 
		 \begin{figure}[!htbp]
		 	\centering
		 	\fbox{\includegraphics[trim=-2cm -0.6cm -2cm -0.6cm, width=0.98\textwidth]{Images/2/ControlValve.pdf}}
		 	\caption[Illustration of a control valve]{Illustration of a control valve \cite{Kriel2014Masters}}
		 	\label{fig: Control Valve Illustration}
		 \end{figure}
		 Many mines utilise automated valves, as illustrated in \Cref{fig: Control Valve Illustration}, at critical locations or on different levels in the compressed air network. These valves control the pressure, thereby restricting airflow from that point in the air network. Restricting airflow reduces losses that result from network inefficiencies and leaks.
		 \par 
		 Kleingeld and Marais \cite{kleingeld2010high} found that optimising valve control on different mining levels can conservatively lead to 20\% energy improvement in mines where no control valves are installed. For systems that already have some form of network control, between 10 and 15\% of savings can conservatively be achieved.
		 \par 
		 The literature revealed that the advantages of control valve optimisation bring about a significant saving that can be achieved within a relatively short set-up time. Savings can be achieved incrementally with each control valve installation. Previous studies looked at simplified estimations of energy improvement that may result from underground control valve optimisation. However, integrated simulation has not yet been used to accurately determine the energy savings and shaft pressure improvements that may occur \cite{schroeder2009energy}, \cite{kleingeld2010high}, \cite{marais2009increased}, \cite{Neser2008}.%%%%%.	 
		\subsubsection{Improving pneumatic rock drill efficiency}
		 Although pneumatic rock drills constitute the largest air consumers in a mine, the energy conversion of pneumatic drilling is very inefficient. Thus, replacing pneumatic drills with more efficient alternatives such as hydraulic or pneumatic drills would lead to large energy savings \cite{Pascoe2016Masters}. Alternatively improving the efficiency of pneumatic drilling can have a significant energy impact on the system, without causing the cost and safety concerns of alternative drilling technologies.
		 \par 
		 A study by Bester \textit{et al.} \cite{bester2013effect} that looked at the effect of compressed air pressure on energy demand, showed that compressed air and energy consumption per tonne of ore produced steadily increased between 2002 and 2013. The shift in energy and air volume per tonne of produced ore over time is illustrated in \Cref{fig: Compressed energy and deep level per ton}. 
		 \par
		 \footnotetext[1]{H. Heller, \enquote*{Compressor Performance Data,} Impala Platinum Mine UTS , 2002 - 2013.}
		 The increase of air consumption per tonne resulted from reduced air pressure at the mining areas. The pressure reduction caused a drop in the drilling rate, which led to higher air consumption. Pressure measurements as low as 300 kPa were recorded in these regions. In 2002, the drilling pressure in the mining section (stopes) was maintained above 500 kPa at most mines\footnotemark[1]. 
		 \par 
		 \begin{figure}[!htbp]
		 	\centering

		 	\label{fig: Compressed energy and deep level per ton}
		 \end{figure}
	 \clearpage
		 Research shows that lowering the pressure reduces the efficiency and drill rate of rock drilling, which leads to higher air consumption. Interventions that reduce systemic air losses or optimise supply can increase the operating pressure. Increased pressure, during the drilling shift may however add more value than the energy cost savings that can be achieved at a lower pressure \cite{bester2013effect}.
	\subsection{Summary}
	The above section reviewed previous studies that achieved energy improvements in compressed air systems. The literature was divided into studies that focus on improving the supply of compressed air and those that optimise the demand compressed air.
	\par
	Compressed air supply interventions that were discussed included optimising compressor control and reconfiguring compressor networks. On the demand side, studies that investigated reducing leaks, optimising underground valve control and improving rock drill efficiency were discussed.
\section{Use of simulations to identify improvements in mining systems}
	\subsection{Preamble}
	The value of simulation in the mining industry has been widely shown through its usage in \gls{dsm} initiatives. Simulation and estimation procedures were applied to identify, and pre-emptively quantify the effect of energy interventions strategies for the water reticulation, cooling, compressed air and ventilation systems of mines.
	\par
	 The purpose of this section is to summarise and discuss the work that has so far been done concerning the estimation and simulation of mining systems. This section will also discuss simulation development procedures and verification methodologies that were applied in literature.
	
	\subsection{Estimating energy savings on mining systems }
	Estimation has been a vital tool to determine the potential energy impact that can be achieved from interventions to a mining system. Before new tools existed that allow for the quick development of simplified simulation models, estimation techniques were frequently used to determine the feasibility of energy interventions. 
	\clearpage
	\par 
	The shortcomings of the estimation approaches are that they typically rely on simplified system models. The simplifications lead to high prediction error and they limit the complexity of scenarios and input/output variables.
		\par 
	Snyman \cite{Snyman2011Masters} used mathematical estimation to determine the expected power savings from initiatives with regard to mining compressed air systems. Due to uncertainty in the estimations, \cite{Snyman2011Masters} predicted results were provided as a range between conservative and best-case estimates. The actual achieved energy impact would fall between these estimations. Snyman's model only estimated the average energy impact and could not provide a resultant power profile or other output variables such as pressure.
		 	
	\subsection{Benchmark modelling}
		 Cilliers \cite{Cilliers2015PHD} developed \enquote{best practice models} using the \gls{cols} benchmarking method. These models provide an energy benchmark that can be used to identify the scope for energy improvement in mining systems. An example of a benchmark model for a mining compressed air system is shown in \Cref{fig: 3D Benchmark}. The model can be used to estimate optimal energy required as a function of the quantity of ore mined (T) and the depth of the  mining shaft (Z). Cilliers furthermore developed benchmark models for mine cooling, water reticulation and ventilation systems.

	\subsection{Value of simulation in Demand-Side Management(DSM) of mining projects}
	Van Niekerk \textit{et al.} \cite{van2013value}, \cite{vanNiekerk2012Value} investigated the value of simulation models in \gls{dsm} projects and they developed simulation models for compressed air and water reticulation systems using KYPipes' simulation engine. 
	\par 
	The studies by Van Niekerk \textit{et al.} showed that simplified simulations could be used to quickly estimate energy cost benefits of proposed \gls{dsm} projects. The studies focused solely on the energy saving potential from \gls{dsm} projects. A detailed simulation model was not investigated in favour of (quick-to-develop) or simplified compressed air models.
	\par
	%\subsubsection{Mine cooling systems}
	Simulation has been commonly used in studies as a tool to improve mine cooling. Holman \cite{Holman2014Masters} investigated improvements to mine cooling systems that enhance performance and efficiency. In the study, \gls{ptb} was used to develop and solve simplified simulation models aimed at investigating cooling interventions.
	\par 
	The scenario the Holman simulated showed a potential average power reduction of 136 kW which would lead to an annual energy cost saving of R0.55m. The study could be improved by increasing the accuracy of the simulation. A power error of as high as 31\% was observed between the simulation and actual for some time periods.
	\par
	%\subsubsection{Mine de-watering systems}	
	%\subsubsection{Mine compressed air systems}		
	Simulation has had great value in improving and optimising mining compressed air systems. A detailed review of compressed air simulation applications is discussed in Section \ref{CompressorSimulation Literature}.
	\subsection{Simulation procedure}
	A structured simulation procedure is required to achieve the objectives of the study. Previous studies from literature focus on how simulation software tools work, rather than on the simulation procedure that was followed \cite{Mare2016PhD}.
	\par
	Bouwer \cite{bouwer2004designing} developed a software tool that he used to investigate extensive thermal and energy systems. He followed the steps below to implement simulations:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Create a detailed schematic of the system
		\item Obtain data from installed instrumentation
		\item Perform manual measurements where necessary
		\item Gather data for a typical operational period
		\item Convert data into useful formats
		\item Set up the simulation model
		\item Calibrate the model until simulated outputs match measured data
	\end{itemize}
	Bouwer's simulation procedure provides a good guideline for mining system simulation. The procedure could be simplified by merging steps. For example, steps 1 to 4 could be merged into a single step, namely \enquote{Gather system data and information}.
	\subsection{Periodic/repeated simulation procedure}
	The concept of a periodic or repeated simulation involves the execution of a simulation multiple times or on a recurring schedule while altering input parameters. Hollander and Lui \cite{Hollander2008Estimation} used repeated simulations to estimate travel time distributions for traffic networks. They also developed the following methodology for the repeated simulations:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Gather input parameters
		\item Run simulations
		\item Read simulation outputs
		\item Repeat for desired iterations
	\end{itemize}
	\par
	 Within the mining context, Snyman \cite{Snyman2011Masters} used repeated estimation to determine an upper and lower bound for the expected result. Another example from industry is real-time simulation or estimation systems.
	\par 
	 Van Heerden \textit{et al.} \cite{van2014developing} developed a dynamic control system for a mine compressed air network in which the controller utilised repeated simulation to estimate unmeasured and future parameters of the network. The estimated results were used to optimise the compressor control.
	 \par
	
\subsection{Simulation software tools}
\subsubsection{Available tools}
A software tool is required to create and execute (or solve) the compressed air simulations. The available literature presented a variety of software tools that have been used to simulate industrial systems. A suitable software system for this study must be capable of producing accurate models of complex compressed air networks. The system should be able to solve for transient compressed air simulation scenarios with dynamic data and control inputs.
\clearpage
\par 
The development of system models should furthermore not be excessively time-consuming and the software tools should be able to handle missing data inputs and information that are common in mining systems. These were shortfalls of simulation tools noted by van Tonder \cite{vanTonder2014PhD} and Marais \cite{Mare2016PhD}.
\par
The following simulation tools that may meet the criteria were identified : 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Arrow\footnote{\url{http://www.aft.com/products/arrow}}
	\item Process Toolbox\gls{ptb}
	\item Flownex\footnote{\url{https://www.flownex.com/}}
	\item KYPipe GAS\footnote{\url{http://kypipe.com/gas/}}
	\item AirSim
	\item REMS
\end{itemize}
 \gls{ptb} was used for the current study as it was developed specifically for simulation of mining systems. The design allows simpler and speedier development of system models, because many components such as compressor mathematical models have already been pre-built \cite{Mare2016PhD}. 
 \subsubsection{PTB background}
 \gls*{ptb} is a transient system simulation and optimisation tool and the software was designed for use in mining and industrial thermal hydraulic systems. \gls{ptb} provides a graphical user interface to develop system models by dragging and dropping components intuitively. The interface is shown in \Cref{fig: PTB UI}.
 \par

 	\label{fig: PTB UI}
 \end{figure}
\gls{ptb} System models consist of combinations of nodes and pipes (see an example of a model schematic in \Cref{fig: PTB UI}). Other component models such as compressors, variable flow demands and controllers are available in the component library. A methodology for the development of compressed air system models in PTB is explained in detail in Chapter 3.

%Mare \cite{Mare2016PhD} and Peach \cite{Peach2016Masters} investigated simulation software packages for mining systems; Identifying the strengths and limitations of each. 
 	\subsection{Simulation model verification strategies}\label{VerificationLit}
 	Due to a lack of instrumentation, measurement inaccuracies and the sheer scale of mining systems, it is impossible for a simulation model to match the actual system's operation perfectly. Methods of verifying simulation precision were investigated in the available literature, and the verification techniques identified were the Mean Residual Difference, Mean Absolute Error, the coefficient of determination or correlation and Mean Squared Error.%Most studies utilised a comparison calculation strategy to calculate a model accuracy or error. %Two calculation methods identified were \emph{Average difference method} and \emph{average percentage difference}. 
 		\subsubsection{Mean residual difference (MRD) method}
 			The mean difference method looks at the average of the actual and simulated time series. Relative error is then calculated using \Cref{eq: AMean absolute}. The simulation percentage error from the physical system is subsequently calculated by dividing the error by the actual data points as is shown in \Cref{eq: Average difference}.
 			
 			\begin{equation}
 			\label{eq: AMean absolute}
 			\bar{R} = \left| \dfrac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^{N}{ \left( A_{n} - S_{n}\right)} \right|
 			\end{equation}
The equation is rewritten to obtain a relative error percentage:	
 			\begin{equation}
 				\label{eq: Average difference}
 				Err_{\%} = \left| \dfrac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^{N}{ \left(\dfrac{ A_{n} - S_{n}}{A_n}\right)} \right| \times 100 \%
 			\end{equation}
 			Where: \par 
 				\begin{table}[!htbp]
 					\centering
 					\begin{tabular}{cl}
 						$A$ & Actual system time series \\
 						$S$ & Simulation time series \\
 						$n$ & Data point \\
 						$N$ & Number of data points in simulation period \\
 					\end{tabular} 
 				\end{table}	
 			\clearpage
 			A major disadvantage of this method is that for transient simulation, the positive and negative errors for individual points can cancel out. This leads to a smaller than expected resultant error that cannot guide the reader to any conclusive statements regarding the accuracy of the model \cite{sarin2010comparing}. If used alone, this strategy is not recommended for verifying transient simulations. 
 			\par 
 						
 			Yu-jie Xu \textit{et al.} \cite{xu2016modeling} developed a steady-state simulation of an absorption chiller. In the study, mean residual difference was utilised as a measure of the steady-state error for an absorber model. The accepted margin of accuracy in the study was a relative steady-state error of 5\%. 
 			
 		\subsubsection{Mean absolute error (MAE) method}
 		The \gls{mae} verification method follows a similar calculation as in the average (mean) residual difference method. However, as shown in \Cref{eq: Relative error}, the error is calculated individually for each point in the series. The average of the individual errors is the resultant error, \Cref{eq: Relative error 2}. The relative error percentage is obtained by dividing each error by the actual value at that time step, as shown in \Cref{eq: Relative error}.
 		\par
 		\begin{equation}
 		\label{eq: Relative error 2}
 		MAE = \dfrac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^{N}{\left|A_{n} - S_{n}\right| }
 		\end{equation}
 		
 			The equation is rewritten to obtain a relative error percentage:	
 			\begin{equation}
 			\label{eq: Relative error}
 			Err_{\%} = \dfrac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^{N}{\left|\dfrac{A_{n} - S_{n}}{A_{n}}\right| }\times 100 \%
 			\end{equation}

 			\end{table} 
 		\subsubsection{Coefficient of determination}
 		The coefficient of correlation is the measure of how accurately a data series ($ x $) can be represented in a linear relationship with data series ($ y $), i.e. $ y = mx+c$. The value of the coefficient ranges between $ -1 $ and $ 1 $ where a value of 1 indicates a perfect linear relationship between the series and a value of $ -1 $ represents a perfect negative linear relationship. A value of 0 indicates that there is no connection between the data series. The correlation coefficient can be calculated using \Cref{eq: Correlation coefficient} \cite{sarin2010comparing}.
 		
 		\begin{equation}
 		\label{eq: Correlation coefficient}
 		r = \dfrac{\sum_{n=1}^{N}(A_n - \bar{A})(S_n - \bar{S})}{\sqrt{\sum_{n=1}^{N}(A_n - \bar{A})^2 \cdot \sum_{n=1}^{N}(M_n - \bar{A})^2}}
 		\end{equation}
 		\par
 		Where \par
 		\begin{table}[!htbp]
 			\centering
 			\begin{tabular}{cl}
 				$A$ & Actual system time series \\
 				$S$ & Simulation time series \\
 				$n$ & Data point \\
 				$N$ & Number of data point in simulation period \\
 			\end{tabular} 
 		\end{table}	
 		The coefficient of determination or R-Squared value can be calculated by squaring the correlation coefficient (r). 
 		\par 
 			Kurnia \textit{et al.} \cite{kurnia2014simulation}, \cite{kurnia2014dust} developed a simulation for a novel underground mining ventilation system. They selected the mathematical model with the highest precision when compared with historical data points. The chosen model had an R-Squared value of 0.96 and a relative error of 30 \%, using the mean absolute error method. 
 			
 		\subsubsection{Mean squared error}	
 		In statistics, the \gls{mse} or \gls{rmse} is the average of the square of the error between the actual and estimated value. The value is always positive. A smaller value relates to a more accurate model\footnote{University of Kentucky Department of Mathematics, \enquote{Estimators, Mean Squared Error, and
 			Consistency, } [Online] \url{http://www.ms.uky.edu/~mai/sta321/mse.pdf}, [Accessed 3 March 2017].}.
 			\begin{equation}
 				\label{eq: rmse}
 				MSE = \dfrac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^{N}{(A_{n} - S_{n})^2}
 			\end{equation}
 			Where: \par

 					$S$ & Simulation time series \\
 					$n$ & Data point \\
 					$N$ & Number of data points in simulation period \\
 			\end{tabular} 
 			\end{table}			
 		\subsubsection{Other methods}
 		Many alternative methods or variations of the methods discussed are available to verify transient simulations. As an example, Arndt \cite{arndt2007integrated} considered the percentage of relative errors under certain limits,as well as a maximum relative error. His method is an improvement compared to the residual difference in ensuring transient simulation accuracy however the results are difficult to interpret.
 		\par
 		Sarin \textit{et al.} \cite{sarin2010comparing} compared many methods. Some of these methods that have not been discussed in this study include:
 		\begin{itemize}
 			\item Vector Norms
 			\item Sprague and Geers Metric \cite{Geers1984Objective}, \cite{Sprague2004Spectral}
 			\item Russells Error Measure \cite{Russell1}, \cite{Russell2}
 			\item Normalised Integral Squared Error
 			\item Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)
 		\end{itemize}
 		The calculations used in the above methods are relatively complex. However, they provide additional measures such as phase, magnitude and slope errors. These metrics could add value in verifying simulations.
 		\subsubsection{Comparing verification methods}
 		The difference between the strategies is best shown using an example. \Cref{fig:Philipp Difference verify} shows the output and actual power of a simulation of a mining system for a 24-hour duration. In the study by Maré \cite{Mare2016PhD}, \gls{mrd} (\Cref{eq: Average difference} ), was used to determine the accuracy of a simulation model.
 		\par 
 		 With \gls{mrd}, positive and negative differences between the simulated and actual profiles were cancelled out and the averages of the two power profiles were very similar. The residual difference relative error was therefore calculated as 1.17\%. However, using the relative \gls{mae} (\Cref{eq: Relative error})  and applying it to the same data series resulted in a relative error of 15.2\%. There is a significant 14\% difference between the two measures.

 	\end{figure}

 The results of other verification methods applied in the example are provided in \Cref{Philip verification table}. From the table, it is clear that the accuracy of the simulation model is not as high as when it was interpreted using the residual difference alone.

 \end{table}
 	Willmott \cite{willmott2005advantages} studied the advantages of using the mean absolute error \gls{mae} rather than the \gls{rmse} method in assessing model accuracy. In his study, Willmott concluded that the \gls{mse} measure is a function of \gls{mae} and therefore does not describe average error alone. Based on the analysis, \gls{mae} was described as the most natural and unambiguous measure of average error magnitude.

 	\subsubsection{Verification usage in previous simulation studies}
 	Previous studies verified simulation accuracy by means of different methods and varying degrees of precision. \Cref{table: Verification studies} summarises these approaches. The majority of local literature utilised the mean residual difference to determine the estimation accuracy. However, from the literature it clear that the mean residual difference does not necessarily indicate model accuracy. 
 	\par 
 	 According to \Cref{table: Verification studies} the majority of local studies utilised residual difference to determine simulation accuracy. However, literature has shown this is not a valid method for transient simulation verification. International studies used correlation, \gls{mae} and \gls{mse} for verification. The accepted accuracy margin ranges from a relative error of 3\% up to 30\%. The majority of studies used either 5\% or 10\%  as the relative error cut-off.

\section{Review of the use of simulation in compressed air optimisation}
\label{CompressorSimulation Literature} \label{simplfiedModels}
\subsection{Preamble}
This section reviews the literature that describes how simulation can be used to optimise compressed air systems. Shortcomings identified from the literature and that can be improved upon in this study are also addressed. The studies that were reviewed in this section are summarised in \Cref{table: cm sim studies}.

\subsection{Compressor energy modelling}
Industrial compressed air systems have significant energy requirements. The system composition can vary widely between air networks depending on the specific air requirement and control measures of the network. Therefore, modelling the energy consumption of a specific system can provide value in determining the performance of an air network and the scope for optimisations.
\par 
In their study, Mousavi \textit{et al.} \cite{mousavi2014energy} provide an overview of techniques to model and optimise the energy consumption of a compressor system. They developed a state-based simulation model that could be used for both fixed and variable drive compressors. Mousavi \textit{et al.} subsequently implemented the model in a manufacturing plant.
\par 
 They used historical data for the system to develop characteristic compressor models and a flow demand profile and used the system model to predict the energy consumption of the plant under a variation of network control scenarios. Their study (Mousavi \textit{et al.}) considered the following control optimisations:
 \begin{itemize}
 	\item Compressor priority determination
 	\item Base-load compressor determination
 \end{itemize}
\par
The study focused on optimisations in the manufacturing industry only and it did not consider improvements in the pressure, flow or temperature process parameters. Mousavi \textit{et al.} did not develop an integrated simulation approach. A simulation approach that integrates and models the compressed air system with manufacturing processes may, therefore, add value to the study.
\subsection{Determining the optimal compressor location}
Determining the optimal location for a compressor can improve the efficiency of an air network, and this improvement can lead to significant energy cost savings. Zahlan and Asfour \cite{zahlan2015multi} investigated the use of simulation to solve the problem of optimal location of a compressor in the manufacturing industry.
\par 
To determine the optimal location of a compressor, Zahlan and Asfour divided the manufacturing facility into a matrix of rectilinear zones. A mathematical model was developed in MATLAB to determine the energy consumption of the compressors when located in each zone.
\par
\begin{figure}[!htbp]
	\centering
	\fbox{\hspace{1cm}\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{Images/2/Zones/zones.pdf}\hspace{1cm}}
	\caption[Simulated energy consumption matrix]{Resultant energy consumption matrix (adapted from Zahlan and Asfour \cite{zahlan2015multi})}
	\label{fig: EnergyconsumptionMatrix}
\end{figure} 
User preference was taken into account by determining a parameter of the extent of the user preference for each zone in the matrix. The user preference parameter and energy savings per zone were weighted and summed to arrive at the optimal zone. \Cref{fig: EnergyconsumptionMatrix} shows the simulated energy consumption for the compressors at each zone location. The energy consumption was combined with a user preference matrix to determine the optimum compressor location.
\par
The approach towards determining the optimum compressor location would not be suitable for mining compressed air system. Mining air networks extend for kilometres in the x, y and z planes. Zahlan and Asfour greatly simplified the compressed air network processes to easily formulate the mathematical model. This approach would not be suitable for larger and more complex mining air networks.

\subsection{Compressor relocation in a mining system}
 Bredenkamp \cite{Bredenkamp2013Masters} utilised simulation models to test compressor relocation scenarios in order to improve the efficiency of a mining air network.  The simulation model developed by Bredenkamp (using KYpipe)took into account the location, the supply capacity of each compressor, as well as the surface pipe distances. The model, as visualised in \Cref{fig: bredenkamp model}, simplified the air demand of the network to a single outlet flow per shaft.
\par
\begin{figure}[!htbp]
	\centering
	\fbox{\includegraphics[trim = -0.5cm 1cm -0.5cm 0cm ,width=0.98\textwidth]{Images/2/bredenkamp/model}}
	\caption[Compressor relocation simulation model]{Compressor relocation simulation model (adapted from Bredenkamp \cite{Bredenkamp2013Masters})}
	\label{fig: bredenkamp model}
\end{figure}
The result of Bredenkamp's simulation showed a potential energy cost saving for the mine of R170m over 13 years. The cost savings implied that it was feasible to purchase a new compressor at an estimated cost of R15m. Additional surface pressure delivery improvements were also identified from the simulation.
\par 
Bredenkamp did not follow a clear simulation methodology for developing the compressed air simulation, but utilised the residual difference to calibrate and verify the model parameters. Thus, it can be deduced that the simulation precision could be improved by following a detailed methodology.
\par 
Increasing the detail of the demand components may provide valuable results and show more particular effects that result from the simulated scenarios, such as the specific delivery pressures at mining level as a result of the intervention. In addition, more scenarios or scenario combinations could be simulated, with potentially greater savings.

\subsection{Compressed air ring}
Pascoe \cite{Pascoe2016Masters} developed a simulation model for a compressed air ring. The purpose of the simulation was to identify the benefits of reducing pressure during the blasting shift period through surface valve control. In a second study, Pascoe used simulation to investigate the control benefits of exchanging a large compressor with two smaller compressors.
\par 
\begin{figure}[!htbp]
	\centering
	\fbox{\includegraphics[trim = -0.5cm 0.5cm -0.5cm 0.5cm ,width=0.98\textwidth]{Images/2/pascoe/model}}
	\caption[Simplified compressed air ring model]{Simplified compressed air ring model (adapted from Pascoe \cite{Pascoe2016Masters})}
	\label{fig:Pascoe model}
\end{figure}
 The model required complex supply-side detail, including the modelling of the individual compressor, locations of compressors and pipe lengths and control valves. The demand aspect of the system was simplified to a single flow per shaft, decline or processing plant. A schematic representation of the simulation model is shown in \Cref{fig:Pascoe model}.
 \par

The methodology for simulation development used by Pascoe can be improved. For example, as was the case with Bredenkamp \cite{Bredenkamp2013Masters}, Pascoe utilised the residual difference to calibrate and verify the transient simulation output variables. The simulation precision could therefore be improved by using a suitable transient error calculation method as discussed in \Cref{VerificationLit}.The researcher simplified the air demand models to a single flow per shaft. Integrating the model with the demand process within the shafts could therefore add value.

\subsection{Mine complex}
Maré \textit{et al.} \cite{Mare2017Evaluating} developed a compressed air simulation for a mining complex. In their study, they simulated and prioritised several scenarios with the goal of reducing energy and other operational costs. 
\par
 Maré \textit{et al.} accurately modelled the individual compressors at each shaft in the mining complex. Since the detailed flow consumption at individual mining levels was found to be inaccurate, the process boundaries for the model were selected to include only the deep-level consumption at the shaft. A process schematic for the simulation mode is shown in \Cref{fig:Mare model}.
 
 \begin{figure}[!htbp]
 	\centering
 	\fbox{\includegraphics[trim = -0.5cm 0.5cm -0.5cm 0.5cm ,width=0.98\textwidth]{Images/2/mare/model}}
 	\caption[Simulation model for a complex air network]{Simulation model for a complex air network (adapted from Maré \textit{et al.} \cite{Mare2017Evaluating})}
 	\label{fig:Mare model}
 \end{figure}
\par 
 Eight scenarios were simulated using the model. The combined results showed that there was a potential energy saving of R1.5m, as well as an additional pressure improvement of 51 kPa. The infrastructure and resource costs were estimated to prioritise the interventions and so to ensure the greatest financial benefit to the mines.	
\par
	Maré and his co-authors used the residual difference to calibrate and verify the accuracy of the transient simulations. Therefore, the actual estimation error is greater than what is shown in the study. Through on-site inspections and strategic measurements, the detail of the simulation model could be improved. This could allow for more accurate simulations and more simulation scenarios.

Five compressed air simulation studies were reviewed and the findings are next summarised in \Cref{table: cm sim shortcommings}.  In general, increasing the detail of system models should improve simulation accuracy and allow further simulation scenarios.

\section{Conclusion}
In Chapter 2, a comprehensive study of the relevant literature was performed. First of all, some background information on compressed air networks was provided. This included background regarding various compressed air sub-components, the operational schedules and their effect on compressed air requirements, the typical instrumentation found in a mining compressed air system.
\clearpage
\par
Next a review was conducted of previously achieved energy interventions and improvements in the compressed air systems. The literature was divided into studies that focused on improving the supply of compressed air and those that optimised the compressed air demand.
\par
The use of simulation and estimation in the mining industry was subsequently reviewed. Estimation and benchmark procedures in literature were discussed first, followed by a review of simulation usage in mining \gls{dsm}. Simulation procedures from the literature were studied and various simulation software tools used in industry were compared. Verification procedures were also analysed and compared.
\par 
	Finally, the use of simulation to optimise compressed air systems was reviewed.  Five relevant studies were examined. The shortcomings, successes and potential improvements of previous compressed air simulation studies were discussed and summarised.
