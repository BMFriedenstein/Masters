\section{Introduction}
\section{Review of compressed air energy interventions in industry}
	\subsection{Preamble}
		Compressed air improvement can be obtained through intervention in either the supply or demand of compressed air \cite{Kriel2014Masters}. Improvements in supply interventions are achieved by increasing the efficiency of compressed air supply. Examples of this type of intervention include \gls{dcs}, compressor maintenance, etc. 
		\par
		Due to the size of mining compressed air networks, there is often a larger scope for improvement in air demand. Improving the  demand is achieved by optimising air flow consumers, reducing leaks, etc.
		\par
	 	From literature, this section will review compressed air energy interventions that have performed in industry.
	 	
	\subsection{Strategies to improve compressed air supply}
	
		\subsubsection{Optimising compressor control}
		Compressors types and numbers can differ widely from mining compressed air systems. Compressor selection is crucial in these systems to match the correct compressors with the requirements of the system \cite{marais2010expert}.
		\par 
		In a study by Booysen \textit{et al} \cite{Booysen2012Masters} on optimising compressor control, \cite{Booysen2012Masters} found that many mines control compressors using fixed target pressure points that are much higher that required. In one system, compressors were set to a target 650 \gls{kpa} to ensure pressure underground did not fall below 500 \gls{kpa}. Using high pressure set-points can lead to excessive wasteful blow-off flow when the pressure exceeds a maximum points.
		\par 
		Booysen \cite{booysen2009optimising} showed that through dynamic pressure setpoint control, matching the supply pressure with the demand, and optimal compressor selection, energy savings can be achieved. In a case study, an average power reduction of 1.07 MW was achieved. The lead to an estimated energy cost saving of R3M.

		\subsubsection{Reconfiguring compressed air networks}
			A number of old mining compressed air systems  have not been adequately maintained and improved. Often they cannot sufficiently supply air to meet the demand or air is provided from non optimal sources. In a study by Bredenkamp \cite{Bredenkamp2013Masters}, reconfiguring of the air network was investigated to improve these systems.
			\par  
			In the study, Bredenkamp investigated interconnecting the compressed air systems of two mining shafts and relocating of a compressor. This strategy lead to an average power reduction of 1.7 MW and an estimated annual energy cost saving of R8.9M at the time.

	\subsection{Strategies to reduce compressed air demand}
	As illustrated in \cref{fig: Mining schedule}
		- Reducing leaks\\
		- 
		- Marais PhD\\
		- Snyman - investigated various Compressed air demand reduction and efficiency
		 optimisations \cite{Snyman2011Masters}.
		 
		 \subsubsection{Leakage detection}
		 Air leaks are a major inefficiency in mining compressed air systems. Improving leaks is relatively easier method to  reduce air demand and improve the efficiency of the system  \cite{van2011sustaining}. Air leaks occur as a result of open pipes, fissure and breaks. Losses depend on the size of the leak. \cref{fig: Leak losses} shows the estimated power losses vs leakage area.

		 	\label{fig: Leak losses}
		 \end{figure}
		 Air is often not easily detected through visual methods. In industry, a number of techniques are employed to detect air leaks. Pascoe \cite{Pascoe2016Masters} and van Tonder \cite{vanTonder2010Masters} summarised these strategies as follows:
		 \begin{itemize}
		 	\item Audible detection (Walk and report)
		 	\item Ultrasonic detection
		 	\item Detection through intelligent systems
		 	\item Pigging
		 	\item soap water and dyes
		 \end{itemize}
	 	 These methods can be time and resource intensive and many mines do not actively employ dedicated leakage detection repair teams. Marais \textit{et al} \cite{marais2009increased} investigated streamlining the leakage detection and repair process to increase energy savings through the use of \gls{calds}. The \gls{calds} system was developed to allow centralised mobile leakage reporting. Usage of the system resulted in increased leak detection rate with one mine reporting 24 leaks in a single month. It was noted in the study that there difficulty quantifying the actual energy savings of the leakage repairs due to other intervention occurring simultaneously.

		\subsubsection{Improving pneumatic rock drills efficiency}
		 Pneumatic rock drills are on of the largest air consumers in a mine. Improving the efficiency or drilling can have a significant energy impact of the system. In a study by  Bester \textit{et al.} \cite{bester2013effect} looking at the effect of compressed air pressure on energy demand. Bester showed that between 2002 and 2013 compressed air and energy consumption per tonne of ore produced had steadily increased. This is illustrated  in \cref{fig: Compressed energy and air flow per ton}. 
		 \par 
		 The increase of air consumption per \gls{t} was a result of reduced air pressure at the mining areas. This causes the drilling rate to drop leading to higher air consumption. Pressure measurements as low as 300 \gls{kpa} were recorded in these areas. Before 2002 the drilling pressure at the mining section (stopes), was maintained above 500 \gls{kpa} at most mines. 
		 \par 
		 \begin{figure}[h]
		 	\centering
		 	\input{Graphs/1/EVperT/EVperT}
		 	\caption[The Compressed air energy and flow consumed per T of ore produced.]{The Compressed air energy and flow consumed per T of ore produced. Adopted from Bester \textit{et al.} \cite{bester2013effect}.}
		 	\label{fig: Compressed energy and air flow per ton}
		 \end{figure}
		 From the literature, it is shown that lowering the pressure reduces the efficiency and drill rate of rock drilling, leading to higher air consumption. Interventions that reduce systemic air losses or optimise supply can increase the pressure operating pressure. Increased pressure, during the drilling shift, may add more value than the energy cost savings that can be achieved at a lower pressure.
