\section{Introduction}
\section{Review of compressed air energy interventions in industry}
	\subsection{Preamble}
		Compressed air improvement can be obtained through intervention in either the supply or demand of compressed air \cite{Kriel2014Masters}. Improvements in supply interventions are achieved by increasing the efficiency of compressed air supply. Examples of this type of intervention include \gls{dcs}, compressor maintenance, etc. 
		\par
		Due to the size of mining compressed air networks, there is often a larger scope for improvement in air demand. Improving the  demand is achieved by optimising air flow consumers, reducing leaks, etc.
		\par
	 	From literature, this section will review compressed air energy interventions that have performed in industry.
	\subsection{Strategies to improve compressed air supply}
		\subsubsection{Optimising compressor control}
		- Setpoints\\
		- schecdules
		- Variable speed drives\\
		\subsubsection{Dynamic compressor selection}
		\subsubsection{reconfiguring networks}
		A number of old mining compressed air systems  have not been adequately maintained and improved. Often they cannot sufficiently supply air to meet the demand or air is provided from non optimal sources. In a study by Bredenkamp \cite{Bredenkamp2013Masters}, reconfiguring of the air network was investigated to improve these systems.
		\par  
		In the study, Bredenkamp investigates interconnecting the compressed air of two mining shafts and relocation of a compressor. This strategy lead to an average power reduction of 1.7 MW and an estimated annual energy cost saving of R8.9M at the time.
		- Relocating compressors  - Bredenkamp\\
		- Marais showed compressed air saving potential through an expert control 	system.\cite{marais2010expert}\\
	\subsection{Strategies to reduce/optimise compressed air consumption}
		- Reducing leaks\\
		- Control Valves - Pascoe\\
		- Marais PhD\\
		- Snyman - investigated various Compressed air demand reduction and efficiency optimisations \cite{Snyman2011Masters}.
		\subsubsection{Improving pneumatic rock drills efficiency}
		 Pneumatic rock drills are on of the largest air consumers in a mine. Improving the efficiency or drilling can have a significant energy impact of the system. In a study by  Bester \textit{et al.} \cite{bester2013effect} looking at the effect of compressed air pressure on energy demand. Bester showed that between 2002 and 2013 compressed air and energy consumption per tonne of ore produced had steadily increased. This is illustrated  in Figure \ref{fig: Compressed energy and air flow per ton}. 
		 \par 
		 The increase of air consumption per \gls{t} was a result of reduced air pressure at the mining areas. Pressure measurements as low as 300 \gls{kpa} were recorded in these areas. Before 2002 pressure was maintained above 500 \gls{kpa} at the stopes. 
		 \par

		 	\label{fig: Compressed energy and air flow per ton}
		 \end{figure}
		 From the literature, it is shown that lowering the pressure reduces the efficiency of rock drilling, leading to higher air consumption. Interventions that fix systemic air losses or increase supply can improve the drilling pressure.
