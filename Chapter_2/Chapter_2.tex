\section{Review of compressed air energy interventions in industry}
	\subsection{Preamble}
	(Kriel Masters)
	- Supply and demand strategies (improving compressor efficiency vs reducing/improving demand)\\
	Marais et al investigated increased energy savings through the use of \gls{calds} \cite{marais2009increased}.
	\subsection{Strategies to improve compressed air supply}
		- Control Strategies\\
		- Relocating compressor. reconfiguring networks - Bredenkamp\\
		- Compressor schedules\\
		- Variable speed drives\\
		- Compressor selection\\
		- Marais showed compressed air saving potential through an expert control 	system.\cite{marais2010expert}\\
	\subsection{Strategies to reduce/optimise compressed air consumption}
		- Reducing leaks\\
		- Control Valves - Pascoe\\
		- Marais PhD\\
\\
		- Snyman - investigated various Compressed air demand reduction and efficiency optimisations \cite{Snyman2011Masters}.
		\subsubsection{Improving pneumatic rock drills efficiency}
		Reduced pressure to the drill will cause it to run even less efficiently. A study by  Bester \textit{et al.} showed that between 2002 and 2013 compressed air and energy consumption per tonne of ore produced had steadily increased as shown in figure \ref{fig: Compressed energy and air flow per ton}. The increase in consumption per \gls{t} was a result of a reduction in air pressure at the mining stopes. Measurements indicated that the pressure was as low as 300 \gls{kpa}. This reduced the efficiency of the rock drills. Before 2002 pressure was maintained above 500 \gls{kpa} at the stopes.\cite{bester2013effect} \par
