	 As operational costs of deep level mines increases and gold ore grades decrease, profitability in the gold mining sector is becoming a challenge. Electricity tariff increases have contributed to a rise in the cost of operating mines. Compressed air systems are utilised on mines as they provide safe, reliable  power for various underground machines. Compressed air is also used for emergency oxygen in refuge bays.
	 \par
	 Compressed air systems utilise a significant portion of a mine's total energy. It has been shown that many deep level mine compressed air networks have inefficiencies. Improving the efficiency of these systems could result in a reduction of operational costs by reducing the energy required to produce compressed air. Additionally, an improvement in service delivery could be achieved. 
	 \par
	Previous studies have shown the usefulness of simulations to develop improvements for deep level mining systems. However, these studies have not followed a structured methodology for developing compressed air simulation for deep level mines. Previous studies have also simplified compressed air models reducing the simulation precision and testable scenarios. 
	\par
	 In this study a simulation methodology was therefore developed. Investigations into the compressed air systems are performed. A model is then developed in software to accurately recreate the system operation. Finally a proposed means of improvement is simulated, analysed and quantified in terms of improvements in energy savings and service delivery.
	 \par
	 Two case studies were evaluated. For each case study a variety of scenarios were simulated. In case study A by reducing air used by refuge bays in simulation, a reduction of 1 MW E.E. would be achieved with addition to a significant improvement of 18 kPa to system pressure. Drop tests implemented on the case studies validated the simulation with a precision of 5\%. 
	 \par
	 The study showed that simulation is a important tool for identification improvements in large compressed air systems. By utilising a structured methodology to develop detailed compressed air simulations, inefficiencies and operational improvements were identified.
