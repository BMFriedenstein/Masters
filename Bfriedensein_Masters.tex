As operational costs of deep level mines increase, and gold ore grades decrease, profitability in the South African gold mining sector is becoming a challenge. Electricity tariff increases have contributed to this rise in the cost of operating mines.

	 \par
Compressed air supply systems are the largest energy users in a mine, contributing to approximately 20\% of their total power usage. It has been shown that mining compressed air networks are systemically inefficient. Improving the efficiency of these systems would result in a reduction of energy costs.
	 \par
Previous studies have shown the usefulness of simulations to develop improvements for deep level mining systems. However, these studies have not followed a structured methodology for developing compressed air simulations. Previous studies also used simplified compressed air models, therefore, reducing the simulation precision and testable scenarios.

	\par
In this study, a simulation methodology was developed. Investigations into the compressed air systems are also performed. A compressed air system is then modelled in adequate software to recreate the system operation accurately. Finally, a proposed means of improvement is simulated, analysed and quantified regarding improvements in energy savings and service delivery.
	 \par
Two case studies were evaluated. For each case study, a variety of scenarios were simulated. In Case study 1, two scenarios were simulated on a compressed air system. The results showed that energy cost savings of R0.91M could be achieved. The simulation results were very similar to tests later performed on the physical systems.
	 \par 
The results of case study 2 showed that by reducing air usage at refuge bays, an average power reduction of 1 MW could be achieved. The improvement in efficiency would potentially lead to R 5.2m in annual energy cost savings. Additionally, a significant improvement of 15 kPa to system pressure during the drilling period were identified. Other scenarios showed annual energy cost savings of up to R 2.5m.
	 \par 
An additional analysis was implemented to assess the use of periodically repeated simulations. The results demonstrated that through repeated simulations, operational changes in a system could continuously be identified. This information can then be used for further improvement and cost savings.
	 \par
The study showed that a simulation is a valuable tool for the identification of improvements in compressed air systems. By utilising a structured methodology to develop detailed compressed air simulations, inefficiencies and operational improvements were successfully identified.
