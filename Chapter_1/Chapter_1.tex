\section{Background on deep level mining}

\subsection{Mining profitability}
 Various technical, economic, social and operational challenges are posing a risk to the profitability of the South African mining sector. One of the challenges the sector faces  is a rise in the cost of operation\cite{neingo2016trends}.\par
%\paragraph*{Falling ore grades}\leavevmode\\
A considerable factor that is contributing the the rise of operational costs in South African gold mines has been the increase in electricity costs. As shown in figure \ref{fig: Eskom tariffs} the general cost of electricity has increased at a rate greater than inflation since 2008 \cite{Eskom2013Tariffs}.

	\label{fig: Eskom tariffs}
\end{figure}
\par
In addition to rising electricity cost, gold ore grades in South African mines have fallen substantially over the last few decades\cite{mudd2007global}. As ore grades decline, the energy utilised per unit of metal increases exponentially \cite{muller2010numerical}. Therefore mines require significantly more energy per unit of metal produced. This combination of tariff increases and increased energy usage per unit  have lead to significant rises in mining operation costs. \par

\subsection{Need to improve service delivery and efficiency}
\texttt{Discuss how improvements in service delivery and efficiency will reduce operation costs therefore increase profitability.}
\section{Mining compressed air}
Due to their reliability, versatilely and ease of use, the South African mining industry has installed extensive compressed air networks. These systems can have compressors with capacities of up to 15 \gls{mw} \cite{Marais2012PhD}.\par
However, the supply of compressed air is a highly energy demanding and costly process \cite{padachi2009energy}.  The energy used for compressed air production contributes to between 9\% and 20\% of the total mining energy consumption \cite{Eskom2010Energy,du2011development}. \par
Large compressed air systems are likely inefficient. Internationally, the expected energy savings potential of a large compressed air network is 15\% \cite{neale2009compressed}. Marais \cite{marais2013simplification} showed that energy savings of up to 30\% and 40\% can be obtained from some systems. 
\subsection{Compressed air in operation}
	\paragraph{Operation schedule}\leavevmode\\
	On a typical mine, various operations will take place at different times of the day. Depending on the activity taking place, many mines will control the pressure to meet the requirements \cite{Kriel2014Masters,Marais2012PhD}. Figure \ref{fig: Mining schedule} shows the schedule and pressure requirement on a typical deep level mine. As shown in the figure, the pressure requirement changes depending on the activity taking place.

	\end{figure}
	\paragraph*{Drilling}\leavevmode\\
	A study by  Bester \textit{et al.} showed that between 2002 and 2013 compressed air and energy consumption per tonne of ore produced had steadily increased as shown in figure \ref{fig: Compressed energy and air flow per ton}. The increase in consumption is a result of a reduction in air pressure at the mining stopes. Measurements indicated that the pressure was as low as 300 \gls{kpa}. This would have an effect the efficiency of the rock drills. Before 2002 pressure was maintained above 500 \gls{kpa} at the stopes.  The study showed that as pressure decreased, rock drilling efficiency also decreased.\cite{bester2013effect} \par

\section{Simulations in industry}

Continuous improvements in computing hardware has led to major advancement in software technology. Consequently the use of computational simulation has become an increasingly valuable tool for many industries.\cite{kocsis2003integration} \par 

 In \textit{ Handbook of simulation: principles, methodology, advances, applications, and practice}, the advantages of the use of simulation in industry are discussed as follows \cite{banks1998handbook}: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item The ability to test new policies, operating procedures and methods without causing a disruption to the actual system.
	\item The means to identify problems in complex systems by gathering insight in the interactions within the system.
	\item The facility to compress or expand time to investigate phenomena thoroughly.
	\item The capability to determine the limits and constraints within a system.
	\item The potential to build consensus with regard to proposed designs or modifications.
\end{itemize}
