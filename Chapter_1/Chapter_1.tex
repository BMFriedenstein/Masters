This chapter firstly discusses background regarding deep level mining in South Africa. Next, the need to reduce costs of operation in the mining sector is examined. From this a focus in reducing energy consumption of compressed air systems is developed. Next, background on compressed air operation and energy interventions are discussed. Simulations and their value in industry is discussed leading to a problem statement and objectives of the study. Finally, an overview for the dissertation is provided.
\section{Background on deep level mining}
	\subsection{Mining profitability}
	\footnotetext[1]{inflation.eu, "Historic inflation South Africa - cpi inflation." [Online] \url{http://www.inflation.eu/inflation-rates/south-africa/historic-inflation/cpi-inflation-south-africa.aspx}, [Accessed 25 March 2017].}
	 	Various technical, economic, social and operational challenges are posing a risk to the profitability of the South African mining sector. One of the challenges the sector faces  is a rise in the cost of operation \cite{neingo2016trends}.\par
		%\paragraph*{Falling ore grades}\leavevmode\\
		A considerable factor that is contributing to the rise of operational costs in South African gold mines has been the increase in electricity costs. As shown in figure \ref{fig: Eskom tariffs}, the general cost of electricity has increased at a rate greater than inflation since 2008 \cite{Eskom2013Tariffs}.

		\end{figure}
		\par
		In addition to rising electricity costs, gold ore grades of South African mines have fallen substantially over the last few decades \cite{mudd2007global}. As ore grades decline, the energy utilised per unit of metal increases exponentially \cite{muller2010numerical}. Therefore mines require significantly more energy per unit of metal produced. This combination of tariff increases and increased energy usage per unit have led to significant rises in mining operation costs.
	\subsection{Process of a deep level mine}
	South Africa's mines are some of the deepest in the world Some mine shafts are reaching depths deeper then $4000m$ below the surface \cite{vosloo2012case}. The process of extracting ore at these depth is dependent on the essential services, mainly cooling and ventilation, pumping, compressed air and hoisting, as shown in figure \ref{fig: Mining Layout}.
	\par 
	 Cooling and ventilation system are required to maintain safe working temperatures underground. Pumping is critical to remove service and fissure water, preventing flooding. Compressed air is needed to safely power underground drills and machines. Finally hoisting systems are used to bring the ore to the surface and to transport mine workers in the mine.

	\subsection{Mining Services}
		\subsubsection{Energy usage}
			The mining industry uses extensive amounts of energy. In South Africa, the industry utilizes approximately 15\% of the national electricity supplier's yearly output, of which, gold and platinum mines use 80\%.\cite{Eskom2010Energy}
			\par
			Figure \ref{fig: Energy Split} shows the division of energy within the mining industry. The chart shows that compressed air systems utilises the most energy within a mining industry. It is reasoned that energy can be most effectively reduced through the implementation of energy interventions on compressed air systems.

\section{Compressed air systems in mining}
	\subsection{Compressed air in operation}
		Largely due to their reliability, versatilely and ease of use, the South African mining industry has installed extensive compressed air networks. These systems can have compressors with capacities of up to 15 \gls{mw} \cite{Marais2012PhD}.However, the supply of compressed air is a highly energy demanding and costly process \cite{padachi2009energy}.  The energy used for compressed air production contributes to between 9\% and 20\% of the total mining energy consumption	\cite{Eskom2010Energy},\cite{du2011development}. 
		\par
		Large compressed air systems are likely inefficient. Internationally, the expected energy savings potential of a large compressed air network is 15\% \cite{neale2009compressed}. Marais \cite{marais2013simplification} showed that energy savings of up to 30\% and 40\% can be attained through various interventions. 
		\paragraph{Pneumatic rock drills}\leavevmode\\
	 		Drilling is mainly performed in the production areas or stopes of a mine. Drill machines are used to drill holes into the rock face. Once the holes have been drilled, explosives are then installed to break up the rock \cite{van2008development}.
	 		\par
	  		Compressed air is used to power pneumatic rock drills within a mine. Pneumatic rock drills run at an efficiency of 2\%. This is low when compared to alternative rock drills such as electric, oil electro-hydraulic and hydro-powered drills that run at an efficiency of between 20-31\% \cite{fraser2008saving},\cite{vanTonder2010Masters}. 
			\paragraph{Refuge bays}\leavevmode\\
				Refuge bays are installed in mines to provide safety to miners during emergencies. Most mines will utilise compressed air to deliver safe, cool air to the refuge bay. The provision of 1.42 $l/s$ of air per person at a pressure between 200 and 300 \gls{kpa} is required to provide oxygen and prevent any poisonousness gas entering the refuge \cite{brake1999criteria}.\par
				Airflow in the refuge bays can be controlled with a manual valve within the chamber. Any many cases, this valve is often misused by mine workers who open the valves fully in order to cool the bay through the decompression of the air. \texttt{*** need source ***}
			\paragraph{Compressed air control}\leavevmode\\
				On many large compressed air networks, the intake guide vain position on a compressor is manipulated in order to obtain the air flow and pressure requirements. Typically, guide vains are opened and closed to increase and decrease the compressors discharge pressure. When more pressure is required than can be obtained with the guide vains fully opened, another compressor is needed to operate.\par
				As shown in the figure \ref{fig: Guide vain position}, showing guide vain positions vs power for a typical mining compressor, the guide vains are controlled between 40\% and 100\% of their fully open position. Reducing and increasing the guide vain position will effect the power output of the compressor.The relationship between power and guide vain position of a compressor can be approximated as a linear function. A guide vain position of 40\% will relate to an output power of about 60\% of maximum power.

					\label{fig: Guide vain position}
				\end{figure}
			\paragraph{Operation schedule}\leavevmode\\
				On a typical mine, various operations will take place at different times of the day. Depending on the activity taking place, many mines will control the pressure to meet the requirements \cite{Kriel2014Masters},\cite{Marais2012PhD}. Figure \ref{fig: Mining schedule} shows the schedule and pressure requirement on a typical deep level mine.\par 
				As shown in the figure, the pressure requirement changes depending on the activity taking place. The drilling shift typically has the highest pressure requirement whilst blasting shift requires the lowest. Schedules and operation philosophies can differ between mines. Different operational schedules require alternative pressure requirement profiles.

	\subsection{Characteristic inefficiencies of compressed air systems}
		Compressed air distribution networks in the mining industry consist of multiple compressors and working areas up to eight kilometres away from the source \cite{Marais2012PhD}. Due to their size and complexity, these systems are prone to large energy losses.
		\par 
		Compressed air leakage accounts for as much as 35\% of the energy losses of a compressed air network \cite{Lawrence2004Improving}. Other systemic losses include, faulty valves, pipe diameter fluctuations, obstructed air compressor intake filters and inefficient compressors. 	
		\subsection{Instrumentation and measurements}
		For large industrial systems, thorough instrumentation is necessary in order to monitor performance and condition throughout the system. In a mining compressed air network, instrumentation is installed on the compressor to monitor flows, pressures, temperatures and guide vain position. Electrical instrumentation is also installed for sensing currents, power factors, voltages and power. On control valves, input/output pressures, flows and valve position are usually measured with instrumentation.	
		\par

	\subsection{Inefficiency identification methods}
		Leakage and inefficiency detection strategies is not often pursued in the South African mining industry \cite{vanTonder2010Masters}. Many mines do however perform leak inspections either internally or by a outside company. In these inspections, an ultrasonic detector is used to locate the leak. Alternatively, some mines employ the \enquote{walk and listen} method to identify leaks from the audible sound that it produces \cite{vanTonder2010Masters}. Once the inspection is completed, the findings, including the locations and estimated costs of all identified leaks, are reported.

	\subsection{Compressed air savings strategies}
		The main strategies fo reducing energy on compressed air systems are summarised as follows \cite{Snyman2011Masters}:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Reducing leaks.
			\item Reducing demand.
			\item Reducing unauthorised usage.
			\item Increasing supply efficiency.
			\item Optimising supply.
		\end{itemize}

	\section{Use of simulation in industry }
	\subsection{Background in industrial simulation}
		Continuous improvements in computing hardware has led to major advancement in software technology. Consequently the use of computational simulation has become an increasingly valuable tool for many industries.\cite{kocsis2003integration} \par 
		In \textit{ Handbook of simulation: principles, methodology, advances, applications, and practice}, the advantages of the use of simulation in industry are discussed as follows \cite{banks1998handbook}: 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The ability to test new policies, operating procedures and methods without causing a disruption to the actual system.
			\item The means to identify problems in complex systems by gathering insight in the interactions within the system.
			\item The facility to compress or expand time to investigate phenomena thoroughly.
			\item The capability to determine the limits and constraints within a system.
			\item The potential to build consensus with regard to proposed designs or modifications.
		\end{itemize}
	\subsection{Thermal-hydraulic simulation}
		\gls{ths} is the modelling and computational analysis of Thermal-hydraulic systems. \gls{ths} models can be developed large mining systems such as cooling, compressed air water reticulation etc. In industry, various \gls{ths} software packages are used for modelling and simulating these systems. Two such packages discussed in this dissertation are KY-pipe and Simulation Toolbox.
	\subsection{Use of simulation in mining}
		In industry, simulations have mainly been used as an initial verification of \gls{dsm} energy intervention proposals \cite{Kriel2014Masters}. This removes potential risks that would arise from testing the interventions on the actual mining systems. However these simulations are typically highly simplified models \cite{marais2013simplification}.
		
		
	\section{Problem statement and objectives}
	\subsection{Problem statement}
 		Rising costs and falling ore grades are driving in the mining industry to reduce operational inefficiencies. Large energy savings can be made in Compressed air systems in the mining industry. However manual testing of interventions can be cumbersome.
 		\par
 		Computer modelling and simulation of compressed air systems can be used to quantify and prioritise operational interventions that improve efficiency. The simulations would allow scenarios to be evaluated with minimal risk.
	\subsection{Research objectives}
		The main objective of this dissertation is achieve energy savings and identify operational improvements in mining compressed air systems. A simulation process to will be developed to achieve this goal.
