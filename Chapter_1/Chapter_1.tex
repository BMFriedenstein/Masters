\subsection{Mining systems and energy}

\section{Mining compressed air}
Due to their reliability, versatilely and ease of use, South African gold and platinum mines have installed extensive air networks. These systems can have compressors with capacities of up to 15 \gls{mw} \cite{Marais2012PhD}.\par
The supply of compressed air is highly energy demanding and costly process \cite{padachi2009energy}.  In 2010 the used energy for compressed air production contributed to approximately 17\% of total mining energy consumption.\cite{Eskom2010Energy} 
\subsection{Compressed air in operation}
	\paragraph{Operation schedule}\leavevmode\\
	On a typical mine, various operations will take place at different times of the day. Depending on the activity taking place, many mines will control the pressure to meet the requirements \cite{Kriel2014Masters,Marais2012PhD}. Figure \ref{fig: Mining schedule} shows the schedule and pressure requirement on a typical deep level mine.

	\paragraph*{Drilling}\leavevmode\\
	A study by  Bester \textit{et al.} showed that between 2002 and 2013 compressed air and energy consumption per tonne of ore produced had steadily increased as shown in figure \ref{fig: Compressed energy and air flow per ton}. The increase in consumption is a result of a reduction in air pressure at the mining stopes. Measurements indicated that the pressure was as low as 300 \gls{kpa}. This would have an effect the efficiency of the rock drills. Before 2002 pressure was maintained above 500 \gls{kpa} at the stopes.  The study showed that as pressure decreased, rock drilling efficiency also decreased.\cite{bester2013effect} \par

\section{Simulations in industry}

Continuous improvements in computing hardware has led to major advancement in software technology. Consequently the use of computational simulation has become an increasingly valuable tool for many industries.\cite{kocsis2003integration} \par 

 In \textit{ Handbook of simulation: principles, methodology, advances, applications, and practice}, the advantages of the use of simulation in industry are discussed as follows \cite{banks1998handbook}: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item The ability to test new policies, operating procedures and methods without causing a disruption to the actual system.
	\item The means to identify problems in complex systems by gathering insight in the interactions within the system.
	\item The facility to compress or expand time to investigate phenomena thoroughly.
	\item The capability to determine the limits and constraints within a system.
	\item The potential to build consensus with regard to proposed designs or modifications.
\end{itemize}
