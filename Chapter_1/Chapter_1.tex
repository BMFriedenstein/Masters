\section{Background on deep level mining}

\subsection{Mining profitability}
 Various technical, economic, social and operational challenges are posing a risk to the profitability of the South African mining sector. One of the challenges the sector faces  is a rise in the cost of operation\cite{neingo2016trends}.\par
%\paragraph*{Falling ore grades}\leavevmode\\
A considerable factor that is contributing the the rise of operational costs in South African gold mines has been the increase in electricity costs. As shown in figure \ref{fig: Eskom tariffs} the general cost of electricity has increased at a rate greater than inflation since 2008 \cite{Eskom2013Tariffs}.

	\label{fig: Eskom tariffs}
\end{figure}
\par
In addition to rising electricity cost, gold ore grades in South African mines have fallen substantially over the last few decades\cite{mudd2007global}. As ore grades decline, the energy utilised per unit of metal increases exponentially \cite{muller2010numerical}. Therefore mines require significantly more energy per unit of metal produced. This combination of tariff increases and increased energy usage per unit  have lead to significant rises in mining operation costs. \par

\subsection{Mining systems and energy}
The mining industry uses extensive amounts of energy. In South Africa, the industry utilizes approximately 15\% of the national electricity supplier's yearly output. Of which, gold and platinum mines use 80\%.\cite{Eskom2010Energy}\par
Figure \ref{fig: Energy Split} shows the division of energy within the mining industry. From the chart it is reasoned that energy can be reduced most effectively through implementing energy interventions on mining material handling, processing and compressed air systems.

\section{Mining compressed air}
Due to their reliability, versatilely and ease of use, South African deep levels have installed extensive compressed air networks. These systems can have compressors with capacities of up to 15 \gls{mw} \cite{Marais2012PhD}.\par
However, the supply of compressed air is a highly energy demanding and costly process \cite{padachi2009energy}.  The energy used for compressed air production contributes to between 9\% and 20\% of the total mining energy consumption \cite{Eskom2010Energy,du2011development}. \par
Large compressed air systems are likely inefficient. Internationally, the expected energy savings potential of a large compressed air network is 15\% \cite{neale2009compressed}. Marais \cite{marais2013simplification} showed that energy savings of up to 30\% and 40\% can be obtained from some systems. 
\subsection{Compressed air in operation}
	\paragraph{Operation schedule}\leavevmode\\
	On a typical mine, various operations will take place at different times of the day. Depending on the activity taking place, many mines will control the pressure to meet the requirements \cite{Kriel2014Masters,Marais2012PhD}. Figure \ref{fig: Mining schedule} shows the schedule and pressure requirement on a typical deep level mine. As shown in the figure, the pressure requirement changes depending on the activity taking place.

	\end{figure}
	\paragraph*{Pneumatic rock drills}\leavevmode\\
	Compressed air is used to power pneumatic rock drills within a mine. These drills are heavy, hard to manoeuvre and  and inefficient \cite{van2008development}. However mines have widely adopted the use pneumatic drills for there reliability. \par
	Drilling is mainly performed in the production areas or stopes of a mine. The drills are used to drill holes into the rock face. Once the holes have been drilled, explosives are installed to break up the rock.\par
	A study by  Bester \textit{et al.} showed that between 2002 and 2013 compressed air and energy consumption per tonne of ore produced had steadily increased as shown in figure \ref{fig: Compressed energy and air flow per ton}. The increase in consumption per \gls{t} was a result of a reduction in air pressure at the mining stopes. Measurements indicated that the pressure was as low as 300 \gls{kpa}. This reduced the efficiency of the rock drills. Before 2002 pressure was maintained above 500 \gls{kpa} at the stopes.  The study showed that reducing pressure delivered to the drills will reduce the efficiency of the drill.\cite{bester2013effect} \par

	\end{figure}

\paragraph*{Refuge bays}\leavevmode\\
Refuge bays are installed in mines to provide safety to miners during emergencies. Most mines will utilise compressed air to deliver safe, cool air to the refuge bay. The provision of 1.42 $l/s$ of air per person at a pressure between 200 and 300 \gls{kpa} is required to provide oxygen and prevent any poisonousness gas entering the refuge \cite{brake1999criteria}.\par
Airflow in the refuge bays can be controlled with a manual valve within the chamber. Any many cases, this valve is often misused by mine workers who open the valves fully in order to cool the bay through the decompression of the air. \texttt{*** need source ***}
\paragraph*{Compressed air control}\leavevmode\\
On many large compressed air networks, the intake guide vain position on a compressor is manipulated in order to obtain the air flow and pressure requirements. Typically, guide vains are opened and closed to increase and decrease the compressors discharge pressure. When more pressure is required than can be obtained with the guide vains fully opened, another compressor is needed to operate.\par
 As shown in the figure \ref{fig: Guide vain position}, showing guide vain positions vs power for a typical mining compressor, the guide vains are controlled between 40\% and 100\% of their fully open position. Reducing and increasing the guide vain position will effect the power output of the compressor. However,  the power and guide vain position of a compressor are not related linearly. A guide vain position of 40\% will relate to an output power of about 60\% of the compressors rated maximum power.

	\subsection{Characteristic inefficiencies}
	As large compressed air distribution networks in the mining industry consist of multiple compressors with working areas up to eight kilometres away \cite{Marais2012PhD}. The systems are prone to large energy losses due to various characteristic inefficiencies. \par 
	Compressed air leakage accounts for as much as 35\% of the energy losses of a compressed air network \cite{Lawrence2004Improving}. Other systemic losses include, faulty valves, pipe diameter fluctuations, obstructed air compressor intake filters and inefficient compressors. \par

\section{Simulations in industry}

Continuous improvements in computing hardware has led to major advancement in software technology. Consequently the use of computational simulation has become an increasingly valuable tool for many industries.\cite{kocsis2003integration} \par 

 In \textit{ Handbook of simulation: principles, methodology, advances, applications, and practice}, the advantages of the use of simulation in industry are discussed as follows \cite{banks1998handbook}: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item The ability to test new policies, operating procedures and methods without causing a disruption to the actual system.
	\item The means to identify problems in complex systems by gathering insight in the interactions within the system.
	\item The facility to compress or expand time to investigate phenomena thoroughly.
	\item The capability to determine the limits and constraints within a system.
	\item The potential to build consensus with regard to proposed designs or modifications.
\end{itemize}
