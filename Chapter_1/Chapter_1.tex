\section{Mining compressed air}
The supply of compressed air is highly energy demanding and costly process \cite{padachi2009energy}.  According to *** energy related to the production of compressed air made up approximately x\% of total industrial energy demand ***need a recent source for this***.
However, 
\subsection{Compressed air in operation}
	Due to their reliability, versatilely and ease of use, South African gold and platinum mines have installed extensive air networks. These systems can have compressors with capacities of up to 15 \gls{mw}\cite{Marais2012PhD}.\par
	Compressed air is utilised for a variety of applications in the mining industry.
	
	A study by  Bester \textit{et al.} showed that between 2002 and 2013 compressed air and energy consumption had steadily increased as shown in \ref{fig: Compressed energy and air flow per ton}. The increase in consumption is a result of a reduction in air pressure at the mining stopes. Measurements indicated that the pressure was as low as 300 \gls{kpa}. This would have an effect the efficiency of the rock drills. Historically, before 2002, pressure was maintained above 500 \gls{kpa} at the stopes.  It was concluded that the lower pressure was the cause of the slower drilling rate.\cite{bester2013effect} \par

\section{Simulations in industry}

Continuous improvements in computing hardware has led to major advancement in software technology. Consequently the use of computational simulation has become an increasingly valuable tool for many industries.\cite{kocsis2003integration} \par 

 In \textit{ Handbook of simulation: principles, methodology, advances, applications, and practice} Banks discusses some of the advantages of the use of simulation in industry: \cite{banks1998handbook}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The ability to test new policies, operating procedures and methods without causing a disruption to the actual system.
	\item Identify problems in complex systems by gathering insight in the interactions within the system.
	\item Simulation allows you to compress or expand time to investigate phenomena thoroughly.
	\item With simulation the limits and constraints within a system can be determined.
	\item Stimulation can help build consensus with regard to proposed designs or modifications.
\end{itemize}
