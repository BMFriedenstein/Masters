\section{Background on deep level mining}

\subsection{Mining profitability}
Background on rising mining costs (energy, wages, etc), falling ore grades and Eskom tariffs.\cite{neingo2016trends}

\subsection{Mining systems and energy}
Focus an mine electrical energy users. Compressed air and its inefficiencies
\subsection{Need to improve service delivery}
\section{Mining compressed air}
The supply of compressed air is highly energy demanding and costly process \cite{padachi2009energy}.  According to *** energy related to the production of compressed air made up approximately x\% of total industrial energy demand ***need a recent source for this***. \par
However, due to their reliability, versatilely and ease of use deep level mines have installed extensive piping networks and compressors with capacities of up to 15 \gls{mw} \cite{Marais2012PhD}.

\section{Simulations in industry}

Continuous improvements in computing hardware has led to major advancement in software technology. Consequently the use of computational simulation has become an increasingly valuable tool for many industries.\cite{kocsis2003integration} \par 

 In \textit{ Handbook of simulation: principles, methodology, advances, applications, and practice} Banks discusses some of the advantages of the use of simulation in industry: \cite{banks1998handbook}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The ability to test new policies, operating procedures and methods without causing a disruption to the actual system.
	\item Identify problems in complex systems by gathering insight in the interactions within the system.
	\item Simulation allows you to compress or expand time to investigate phenomena thoroughly.
	\item With simulation the limits and constraints within a system can be determined.
	\item Stimulation can help build consensus with regard to proposed designs or modifications.
\end{itemize}
